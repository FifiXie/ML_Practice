      "Scientifically speaking, there is only one true cinnamon, which is most commonly called \"Ceylon cinnamon,\" and comes from the plant Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The other type of cinnamon which you find mostly in the grocery stores is called cassia cinnamon. If the label just says cinnamon, it is most probably cassia cinnamon. Why is this important?<br /><br />The term \"cassia\" never refers to Ceylon cinnamon but rather to other species of cinnamon, including Cinnamomum cassia (alternatively called Cinnamomum aromaticaum) and Cinnamomum burmannii. While most simply referred to as \"cassia,\" you'll often find Cinnamomum aromaticaum being referred to as \"Chinese cinnamon\" or \"Saigon cinnamon,\" and you'll find Cinnamomum burmannii being called \"Java cinnamon\" or \"Padang cassia.\"<br /><br />Ceylon cinnamon is typically more expensive than any of the cassia versions, and it is also the cinnamon more closely associated with potential health benefits involving blood sugar regulation. To me, cassia cinnamon is stronger tasting while Ceylon cinnamon is more delicate.<br /><br />What true cinnamon and cassia do not have in common is their coumarin content. Coumarins are naturally occurring plant components that can have strong anticoagulant properties. Because our blood needs to maintain its ability to coagulate in times of injury, excessive intake of coumarins over a prolonged period of time can pose health risks. While the level of naturally occurring coumarins in Ceylon cinnamon appears to be very small and lower than the amount that could cause health risks, the level of naturally occurring coumarins in the cassia cinnamons appears to be much higher and may pose a risk to some individuals if consumed in substantial amounts on a regular basis. For this reason, organizations like the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany have recommended that large amounts of the cassia cinnamons be avoided.<br /><br />Since it is harder to find Ceylon cinnamon in the grocery store, you might find it at places like Trader Joes or whole foods. I do not have either of those stores within an hour drive, so I get mine at places like Amazon.com which has it in bulk at very good prices.

      "Guess what I'm eating right now?<br /><br />You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!<br /><br />I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)<br /><br />I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!<br /><br />It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.<br /><br />There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:<br /><br />140 calories (60 from fat)<br /><br />Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)<br /><br />NO Trans Fat<br /><br />NO Cholesterol<br /><br />5 mg sodium<br /><br />17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)<br /><br />3 g protein<br /><br />If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.<br /><br />(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!)\n",

      "So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine Coon self.<br /><br />I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny.<br /><br />I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat. Give it a whirl.\n",

      "I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with \"filler\" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.\n",

      "I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon.\n",

      "Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to \"knock you out.\" Rather, I do experience a noticeable \"lightening\" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in \"off\" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers.\n",

      "I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not \"organic\", is \"natural\" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.<br /><br />According to [...] ingredients list: \"Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues.\" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.<br /><br />For me the evidence is clear - this is good quality food, my dog loves it and I love that when I buy Newman's Own products, the royalties go to charity!\n",

Tuong Ot Brand Sriracha, easily identifiable by the rooster on the bottle, is by far the most common brand. Tuong Ot Sriracha is like the Heinz Ketchup of Asian food.<br /><br />What does it taste like? Purely spicy. Whenever I use Sriracha, I find that it doesn't really add any flavor to my food. The flavor comes from whatever spices were in the food to begin with. Instead, the Sriracha merely amplifies the spicyness. It really helps out with bland cafeteria food.<br /><br />Why should you buy it? You can use it to make anything spicy. It's pretty cheap, and you will use it far more slowly than ketchup. Also, it doesn't really seem to go bad. Most restaurants keep it unrefrigerated. I've had an unrefrigerated bottle for over a year, and it still seems fine.\n",

Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a \"spice flavor not found in nature,\" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS\">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

      "Having tried all of the Taster's Choice single pack offerings, I would say that the Hazelnut is my favorite because I've always like hazelnut flavored coffees. I also like the VANILLA STICKS but don't find the flavor as intense as the hazelnut's. A flavored, brewed coffee has a more intense and better flavor and has a more effective caffeine jolt, but the Taster's Choice instant is good in its own right.<br />One problem with these coffee packets is that adding too much water can dillute  the taste enough to produce a bland tasting hot beverage. Were I to drink these as my morning coffee, I'd need to make at least three cups to get me going.<br /><br />Mostly I drink these as an after nap cup of coffee at home or as a pick me up cup of coffee at work. It's just far too inconveniet to brew a single cup of coffee at work and have to fool with the cleanup. Heating a cup of water in the microwave only takes two minutes or less. Occasionally I'll make instant coffee on Saturday, the one day of the week I work in the A.M.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I don't care for all the wasteful,extra packaging, and tearing open a single packet envelope while half awake in an unwelcome introduction to the day. Sometimes it's easier just to cut it open with scissors.<br /><br />2. I also am not crazy about the small serving size of individual cups. A jar of coffee would be much preferable, but for whatever reasons Nescafe has chosen to go the single serving route.<br /><br />Finally: I like Nescafe Taster's Choice Vanilla instant coffee and enjoy it as an occasional treat. You might also enjoy it if you don't mind instant coffee.\n",

      "Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!\n",

However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice \"dances\" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.\n",

The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  \"high-end\" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!\n",

I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!\n",

      "I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you.\n",

I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.\n",

Too mushy?<br /><br />Well it arrived packed with cold packs, not enough to freeze it though. The texture, flavor and everything about it was wonderful!<br /><br />I was also worried that since it was so cheap that it would be a low quality feta, but it was WAY better than anything I've been able to get around here. And you certainly can't beat that even with the shipping it was cheaper a 1/4 the cost of what I can find locally.<br /><br />Of course there was that issue that it was 2lbs of feta, which I can't go through very quickly. Fortunately, all the greek sites I found said that freezing it is fine. The texture will change slightly and may put off some people if they just want to snack on it, but its perfectly fine for cooking, salads, omlettes, etc.<br /><br />I have added this seller to my list of favorites and expect to return again and again.\n",

If you've any question, research the product on their website and I think you'll be convinced too.  If you like or prefer \"sea-salt\" either for health or taste, this is simply the best, especially for the price.  This is sea-salt, just that it comes from ancient ocean deposits left millions of years ago, way before any possibility of man-made contamination.  Himalayan salt is the same thing, but look at the price!  Seriously, one taste and you'll never go back to table salt.  Real Salt is purer, and way cheaper than any of the \"sea-salts\".  It doesn't clump and it's even a nice color, unlike grey \"sea-salts\" that are so popular.\n",

      "If it was my first matcha i would had given it 5 starts but I feel i have to disagree with the majority of reviewers.<br />Its certainly a good quality matcha but i found it lacks aroma and taste compared to other matchas i tried(yuuki-cha, o-cha and ippodo). The taste is very light, almost flat and you have to watch the water temperature as when going over 190 it gets very bitter(never had this problem before). By the way I always preheat my chawan, dry it, sift the matcha, check the water temperature and then whisk it.<br />As for packaging thats the first matcha i tried that comes in a inner bag. Personally i find it annoying and messy not to mention that you will have to expose the whole amount of matcha to oxygen in order to make it easier to scoop. i prefer the cans i got before that comes with sealed top and a oxygen absorber inside. I noticed the loss of flavor from Domatcha much faster than usual.<br />Would i buy it again? maybe. Cant beat the amazon fast ordering convenience. sometimes my japanese orders take too long to arrive and i found myself out of my daily green nectar. otherwise i think the extra money im paying for a higher quality is more than worth since my primary reason to drink matcha is flavor.<br />One more thing: dont bother trying to make koicha(thick ceremony style tea) with domatcha. its not the proper grade for it and you will get a very grainy/powdery/bitter drink. Otherwise it makes a good usucha and its certainly a great value for the price.\n",

Then my friend shared this link and I thought \"Why not!\" It arrived quickly, and smelled heavenly. I like dark, strong coffee, and I could tell by the smell it would fit the bill. The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups. So you are saving $17. I love it!!! Order yours today, you won't be disappointed.\n",

      "I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my \"go-to\" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY\">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ\">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]\n",

      "I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with \"meal\" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.\n",

      "I picked up Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave recently because it was on sale at a local health food store. I had already made up my mind, after scouting my local stores to no avail, to purchase the Volcanic Nectar brand online but decided to give this a shot because Volcanic Nectar only has one option available (midway in color between Wholesome Sweeteners' lighter option and this one), whereas this looked like a nice alternative for a dark, \"amber\" variety; claims to be both raw and blue; and was displayed right in front of me (I was already primed to buy blue agave nectar, so what the heck...I wanted to believe). I was very pleased when Wholesome Sweeteners returned Sucanat to its wholesome, hand-made/minimally processed origins and so felt confident buying this product because they take their sweeteners and their organic/Fair Trade status very seriously (despite the strong case for Volcanic Nectar on their site, including their claim that color in blue agave nectar, unlike maple syrup or honey, is immaterial).<br />This is a delicious sweetener--very versatile, with many possible uses, and which can often be substituted for honey in recipes (be careful though, because certain of its properties are quite different; also be aware that fructose is the predominant simple sugar in agave's profile and that its fruity taste might not complement certain foods); the price is usually fairly low, too  for agave nectar. However, Volcanic Nectar--which owns its manufacturing facility--really does produce the only PURE blue agave nectar for sale in the US and the ONLY one that displays Diabetic Friendly certification by the Glycemic Research Institute--THE ONLY AGENCY OF ITS TYPE RECOGNIZED BY THE FDA AND FTC--on its product label. I was able to determine by the glucose level--28%--indicated for Wholesome Sweeteners on their Web site which producer (I thought Nekutli but it was pointed out to me that IIDEA is right on the label) processes their agave products and indeed, it has additives (despite claims on their Web site and toll-free calls to customer service to the contrary--this apparently has to do with Mexico's somewhat cavalier labeling laws). A chemical analysis of pure blue agave nectar should list ONLY fructose, glucose, and inulin--any other sugars in the profile indicate additives that are potentially harmful to diabetics/hypoglycemics. This is a delicious product but is not certified safe for diabetics. Wholesome Sweeteners' site claims a GI of \"39 or less,\" which is much higher than that of Volcanic Nectar; these figures are still below the &lt;55 determined to be safe for diabetics, but their nutritional profile also indicates the presence of other sugars. For diabetics looking for safe, alternative, natural sweeteners, Volcanic Nectar, with its incredibly low GI of 27 and no additives of any kind, is the blue agave nectar of choice (it, too, is delicious although much fruitier than Wholesome Sweeteners, and their FAQ claim processing at a low enough temperature to qualify as \"raw\" ).<br />The bottom line: if you have no blood sugar problems and want an alternative sweetener that tastes good and isn't too expensive, this is fine. I like its darker, less fruity flavor, but I'll be sticking with Volacanic Nectar when the bottle's empty.<br />And for the record, I have no professional/personal connection with either of the firms cited in this review; I'm just a consumer who assumes that, like me, people want the ammunition required for making informed decisions.\n",

      "The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.\n",

The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup.  Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words \"Medium Extra Bold\" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.\n",

      "These are a very crunchy cookie with a creamy center.  The cookie part crumbles into many bits.  There is no neat way to eat them.  I even tried putting a bowl under me.  This method catches a lot of the mess, but not all of it.  If you don't have something under you, you will spill tons of crumbs all over.  It is rather ridiculous & frustrating.<br /><br />The flavor is very good! Out of the 3 cookie flavors I've tried, I like these the best. As for their other cookies, I have tried their fig cookies & their chocolate cream filled. The chocolate cream suffers the same overly messy crumbs as these cookies do & has an odd flavor.  The fig have very little taste & the cookie is soft.  So soft, that it falls apart in your hand before you can even take a bite!<br /><br />While the ingredients are mostly good there is room for improvement: organic soy flour, NON organic soy lecithin (GMO anyone?), inulin & natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients as per the box are as follows:  organic cane sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic rice flour, organic sunflower oil, organic tapioca starch, organic potato starch, organic eggs, organic soy flour, organic rice starch, organic rice syrup, organic nonfat dry milk, organic cocoa, organic arabic gum, organic egg yolks, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), salt, inulin, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor, guar gum.<br /><br />Since there are so few organic gluten free options that taste good these are a better choice than many.  I like Pamela's for example, but they only contain some organic ingredients - hopefully Pamela's changes that.<br /><br />At this point, I have satisfied my curiosity in the Jovial line & am not likely to purchase any more of their products.  I think I'll be sticking with my old stand by; organic milk chocolate covered raisins.  They are delicious, totally organic & not the least bit messy!\n",

      "I was along on a camping trip with my sons scout troop when someone brought along a half dozen or so of this vegetable blend.  It was very convenient since it required no refrigeration, plus it was surprisingly flavorful for a dry blend when made into a soup or stew.  Unfortunately I have to go along with the other reviewer here when he calls it a major rip off.  Even for an average size soup that is about 2 quarts, two bags of this 4 oz size would be needed.  That makes it far more expensive than it is worth when you can add canned vegetables at 10 oz. (minus the water) for about a dollar a shot. At the same time I cannot honestly put down all of the Barry Farm products, thus the extra star I added.  I have bought and used several other dry products from Barry Farms including their bouillon and powdered eggs and have been very satisfied with them, both price and product wise. Unfortunately as for this particular veggie blend, I cannot recommend it despite its fairly decent taste.  Way too expensive. Even if bought at a case at a time...\n",

      "I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!\n",

      "I have a six year old Golden Retriever with an extremely delicate digestive system.  Recently she bled internally after chewing a rawhide.  Needless to say, once I calmed my guilt, I had to find a healthy alternatve because she loved to chew on cheweeze rawhides as a treat.  (My Vet told me rawhides can be extremely dangerous for some dogs.)<br /><br />I knew she liked sweet potato, so when I discovered Sam's Yams, I figured, why not give them a try?  The result, she absolutely loves them!!!  I have to keep reordering 3 bags at a time because she barks at the cabinet we keep them in until I give her another.<br /><br />Sam's Yams is such a wonderful and healthy alternative to rawhide.  It is also a low fat treat, which is wonderful for breeds that have a tendency to put weight on.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this product.  My dog loves them, my Vet approves and that makes me a very happy owner.<br /><br />They are sliced in different sizes for small, medium and large dogs.  If your dogs love to chew, why not give them a try?\n",

      "Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.\n",

      "I like tea, in fact I like it a lot. I've had some good gunpowder green tea in the past from adagio as well as Twinnings and it is a beautiful thing. You put what look like little BBs of green tea into your cup or teapot, add the water, and you can see the tea practically explode into nearly full size leaves of tea (hence the name).<br /><br />Davidson's tea disappoints. The tea leaves really don't expand much which tells me they weren't really rolled the way gunpowder green tea is supposed to be. This tea also lacks flavor (at least compared to the other gunpowder green teas I've tried). I used the same amount to brew the same cup of tea I've been enjoying with Twinnigs and frankly the Davidson's version tasted more like hot water than green tea. This may be because the leaves aren't as compacted as a proper gunpowder green tea so the same tablespoon of tea now has less actual mass of tea leaves, it could be because this tea has a lower quality tea leaf in it, heck it could be because this is an old batch of tea for all I know.<br /><br />The point of this review is to say that this tea was a complete waste of money. I am sorry to say I paid for an entire pound of it. I will try it once or twice more, but if the results remain the same I will likely have to throw out the rest of the bag and that would just make me sad because it would mean that I've wasted both money and tea.<br /><br />I have added a photo of the actual tea I received (compare it to that in the original product photos and you'll see a huge difference). Mine is the one that does not look like it is magically hanging in the air and defying gravity.<br /><br />TL;DR version: Don't buy this tea. It isn't really gunpowder green tea and is not worth your money.\n",

      "I have two senior, indoor cats. Before I introduced Wellness into their diet they were both vomiting almost every day for a month. My vet ran tests but found nothing remarkable. The next step would have been x-rays. I was perplexed and worried about my little ones. Although I did not order this food as a \"cure,\" my newfound awareness of my cats' sensitive digestive systems and what was going into their food drove me to seek another alternative to the Iams Indoor Weight and Hairball Control catfood I was feeding them. They were also hacking up constant fur balls despite the special catfood and daily brushing.<br /><br />My cats have not vomited once in the 2 weeks since I switched them to this catfood! They seem to have more energy too. As if that weren't enough, I have not seen one hairball. Their coats are gorgeous, thicker, shinier and those dry flakes are gone. They are shedding less - when I go to brush them there is less fur in the comb. These are the results after only 2 weeks! I am very impressed with these Wellness products and I am picky about what I give to my furry children. Of course my vet continues to push the Science diet (which my cats hate) and Eukanuba, telling me about the \"tests and trials\" these brands have run that no other brands have, but I believe nature equipped my cats with good instincts about what they should and should not eat. They love this food and it appears to love them back. I feel good about the ingredients. I will continue to give it to my babies along with the Wellness Healthy Weight Formula and the Wellness canned catfood.\n",

Everything came securely wrapped up inside a cozy disposable (or reusable) ice cooler.

But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done.

      "At first I was a little hesitant to buy it because I've heard other dogs won't eat the life source bits, but I was at a local pet store and decided to give it a try. I had looked over the ingredients before so I was familiar with what was in it. I knew that it was a pretty good food and certainly better than most. I decided to give it a try because it wasn't too expensive and it didn't have too much protein. I've tried other really good brands and the ones with too much protein didn't work out. I was surprised the my dog liked it so we stuck with it. To this day he is still eating the same food. He does great on it. No gas. No loose stools. Everything has been great. The size of the kibble works out great for my pug. It's not too big and it's not too small. I also like that it doesn't have corn in it.\n",

I hadn't read the previous reviews very carefully and was surprised when I opened the box and found a bunch of very un-K-cup looking K-cups.  The second thing that hit me was the great coffee aroma, something missing from K-cups in general.  What the hell!  Skepticism aside, into the brewer went the first one.  Cut to the chase - great cup of coffee!  I expected a dripping mess when I removed the K-cup.  Not so.  It leaves a perfect little disposable piece.  No mess.<br /><br />In addition to the Rainforest blend I also have now tried the French Roast Decaf.  Also a treat.\n",

      "I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a \"superfood\"!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me - I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???<br /><br />**update: Amazon customer service was a breeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.\n",

Looks like whole peppers since the one I pulled out of the jar was whole, it looks like the others in the jar are whole, also. This is Made In PERU.  If you want to add a nice flavor and surprise, add a little of this to your tuna, salmon, potato or macaroni salads.  It added another dimension to my pasta sauce along with 'Polar anchovies' and 'Chicken of the Sea chopped clams', it didn't taste fishy at all, just gave it an upscale nuance.  A bit pricey but I can get about 3 uses from this size jar.  Will purchase again.\n",

      "One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!\n",

      "I ordered both the Clear Scalp Shampoo and the Conditioner for Damage and Color Repair since I regularly color my dark hair and like to use products that help sustain the color. I typically buy sulfate-free since those seem to work best, and was a little bit surprised that this formula contained sulfates. However, I didn't notice any negative difference in my color after using it for a just few weeks.<br /><br />The shampoo did seem to be a thorough cleanser,leaving my hair \"squeaky clean\" and once I added the conditioner it left my hair soft and silky as I stepped out of the shower. I found the scent clean and pleasant and it doesn't linger at all after rinsing.<br /><br />Once blow-dried, it did seem that the shampoo might have been a bit of a stronger cleanser than I am used to since my hair was slightly fluffier than usual. It could also be that the conditioner was not as deep conditioning as I have found with other products made for color-treated or damaged hair. I should note that I have relatively \"normal-dry\" wavy hair and this might be a bit more ideal for those who have \"oily-normal\" hair.<br /><br />I would recommend this combo to anyone looking for a super clean head of hair with body, but not to anyone who tends to have dry hair to begin with since it may be a bit too harsh. I also wonder about long term use on color treated hair with a product that contains sulfates, since I prefer those without. They performed pretty well, so I did give the shampoo/conditioner 4 stars, but it could have had 5 if it were sulfate-free.\n",

      "And that's about all my family said!  With five boys, I admit it, I buy kool-aid.  And on a hot summer day, who doesn't love a glass of ice cold Kool-aid?  I know I sure do!<br /><br />All five of the boys like grape and fruit punch, so when they heard about this new flavor, they agreed to give it a shot.  We received it, and I made immediately.<br /><br />Their responses:<br /><br />\"hmm....tastes sort of weird.\"<br /><br />\"It's alright.\"<br /><br />\"I want the purple one.\"<br /><br />Ok, so it wasn't a huge hit.  But it was pleasant enough.  I LOVE mangos, and I LOVE peaches, so I was psyched, but I didn't get a real clear taste of either.  One thing I wasn't a fan of, was the sort of strange after taste.<br /><br />Bottom line-the kids will drink it if I buy it, but it isn't their favorite.  And though it does have less sugar than soda (the label says 33% less) there is still a decent amount in a serving-14g in an 8 ounce glass.\n",

      "Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.\n",

If by chance you don't like dried cherries it's not for you. Personally I got this after the Back to nature apple granola which pales in comparison for overpowered taste of completely dominant odorous fruit (yuk!). This granola has 2g less sugar than the apple which is just right IMO.<br /><br />What I love is that the cherries have a sweet and sour taste, similar to a good raisin but lighter. 10g protein per cup is awesome and truly makes a complete breakfast. All the ingredients are really well balanced with the puffed rice and oats, no soy. Now hopefully amazon will keep this one around...\n",

I'm addicted to the sauce, if I could I would go out and get a giant plastic container, fill it up with it, and pour it over everything there is. I would even consider teriyaki baths. I always want to take a million \"to go\" containers of the sauce when I visit but that would be really rude.  Since I cannot do that, I have found a substitute in Mr. Yoshida.  It's not as thick, and its not exactly the same flavor, it is a delicious marinade/sauce in its own right. If you love teriyaki flavor it's definitely worth trying. I put mine in stir fry, marinate meats, and use it as a dipping sauce for dumplings. I'm sure there is a million other different uses. Mr. Yoshida always does me right!\n",

      "These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case \"& Chive\") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.\n",

      "I purchased NEURO TRIM on a whim. Lately I've been interested in trying different energy drinks, supplement drinks, beverages that claim to aid in weight loss, etc. I was intrigued by the bottle's shape, the purple color of the container, and the unique cap. Per the instructions on the bottle, I didn't consume the beverage until about an hour before dinner. I had been rather hungry that day, so I was surprised that by the time dinner actually arrived, I didn't feel as hungry as I had earlier. Other than a slight sweet taste, the drink was rather tasteless. The closest thing the flavor reminds me of is a weak mixture of Kool-Aid.<br /><br />The packaging says that NEURO TRIM helps with \"healthy weight loss, better digestive health, promotes healthy aging, and helps curb appetite.\" The drink does help with curbing appetite. However, I'm not sure if it has much impact on healthy weight loss. According to the directions, in order for that to happen, a person is supposed to drink a bottle of NEURO TRIM three times a day before each major meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). It might work because by the time you pay for all the NEURO TRIM you're supposed to be drinking, there won't be any money left over to buy any actual food.\n",

      "This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.\n",

      "I really love peanut butter, but one sandwich worth of peanut butter uses up most of your daily intake of saturated fats generally. This powdered stuff doesnt come close. It is as easy to use as simply stirring with a spoon and comes out just fine by my estimation. There isnt really a noticeable drop off for me personally, but i dont really eat really sugary peanut butter anyway (i would normally buy Justin's or somesuch). The chocolate is just right in this as well. Although i wanted to be able to eat PB&J's without taking up all of my fat intake, i also wanted to have something for my daily smoothies. I play around with variations, but my go to drink is kale, banana, apple, mango, and mint with flaxseed meal. This makes a great addition to that blend.<br />Anyway, i have seen mention of cheaper prices elsewhere, but for me, with Prime membership and a $5.50 price point currently, i feel the price is more than adequate, especially when factoring in no shipping and two day delivery.<br />I recommend trying this product. No transfats, high fructose corn syrup, or any added carp. Just a good, simple product.<br />Enjoy!\n",

I have only prepared the drink two ways so far but when it is mixed with water and ice in a blender, it is really good.  When I make it again, I will add my Weight Watchers 2 Points Plus chocolate drink packet.  I will be getting a serving of milk then, too.  For 3 Points Plus a serving, this is a great snack/recovery drink/indulgence.  I have not tried the drink hot and I don't plan on it.  The only drawback I found was when I made the drink with just water (following the directions) I did get a ton of clumps.  I shook the container for about 25 seconds, too.  But, all in all, it is a great drink after a hard workout for some good protein.\n",

      "This is the fourth attempt to post this review, I can only assume I mentioned a country or person or something, so I'll keep it simple.<br />I like curry, any curry (no countries or ethnic groups mentioned)<br /><br />This curry is: -<br /><br />The exact recipe calls for Beef, if you prefer chicken go for it.<br />Cook the meat (whichever you choose) shallow fry, or wok flash fry until cooked through, rare is OK for beef, but obviously not for pork or chicken, cook these thoroughly.<br />Second stage is mix paste and spices with fluid, cook on their own until simmered.<br />Finally add meat, and simmer to taste? That could mean 20 minutes, or 6 hours - I know when I make curry I prefer slow cooked soft meat that has had plenty of time to absorb all he spices, so longer is better. But if you're in a hurry that's fine, it just won't be as fully flavored.<br /><br />So taste?<br />Well that's subjective and personal but I found it hot (spicy) in a white pepper way, and top heavy on the cumin flavor, but this is not uncommon for that part of the World.<br />I guess I was disappointed, I used one mix on three pounds of meat (not the 1-2 pound as suggested) and it was still pretty fiery.\n",

These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!  They are so, so, so good.  Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate?  I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived!

      "I am very happy with the flavor of this coffee! I make my coffee using one scoop per two cups of cold water and that makes a nice moderately dark coffee. I usually add a little dollop of creamy caramel macchiato which brings out the smooth, sweet vanilla taste and decreases any bitterness of the blend. The aroma is enticing and I can't wait to have my first cup of it in the morning -- I think it's a great \"wake up\" coffee. I realize that some people do not care for flavored coffees but this one has a very delicate vanilla taste and I'd recommend it very highly as it's not overpowering.<br /><br />Preference and taste are quite subjective, however, and it might not be for everyone but I sure like it and will likely purchase it again.\n",

I loved the way the crunchy crystals tasted and felt in my mouth; sometimes I would just eat a dry spoonful of Ovaltine straight from the jar and wash it down with a glug of milk. Good times!<br /><br />This USED to be more nutritional than Nesquik, but not anymore. Now, it's just like Nesquik, only sweeter and with LESS of a chocolate taste. Ovaltine isn't special anymore. If I want a chocolate-like flavoring in my milk now, I just buy whatever's cheaper.<br /><br />Since the flavor, texture, and nutritional value have changed so drastically, why even call it Ovaltine anymore?

      "I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try \"Natural Calm\"; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because \"Natural Calm\" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking \"Natural Calm\" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to \"Natural Calm\"...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. \"Natural Calm\" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.\n",

      "If you really want true Kombucha health benefits you need to buy the bottled and refrigerated stuff.  Even cold brewing this tea (to not kill the beneficial bacteria), the tea is not made with a large amount of Kombucha.  I would say this is fruit flavored green tea WITH kombucha not green tea Kombucha as the label states.<br /><br />Overall though the tea has a pleasant taste, has organic green tea leaf, organic lemon grass, organic spearmint leaf, natural passion fruit flavor, natural plum flavor, and Kombucha-Pure extract.  But again, there is just a tiny amount of the Kombucha because apparently it's a pain to grow the fungi needed and that's why the bottled stuff is $2+ per bottle.<br /><br />But you can use as regular tea by hot water steeping (as per the instructions), or you can put in cool water (a couple of ounces) and leave in the fridge to steep for a couple of hours then add cold water up to 8-12 ounces total for a nice chilled beverage.  But don't be misled into thinking this will give you a lot of the probiotic goodies even brewed chilled.  And I do regularly purchase it for making iced green tea in the summer (see it says verified purchase).  So I'm still a fan!\n",

      "My eight year old cat is indoor/outdoor and likes dry food. Occasionally, we would feed him some canned food. For at least two years we noticed symptoms of diarrhea. The vet de-wormed the cat several times, but the diarrhea persisted. We decided to check the listed ingredients on the labels of the dry and canned food our cat eats. We were quite surprised that most protein in the popular brands comes from wheat and corn gluten, a protein that is known to cause intestinal problems in some people.  Grains and grain gluten are also listed as ingredients of most brands of cat canned food.<br /><br />I just got the Wellness Core Grain-free Fish & Fowl food today, so it is too early to see if it will cure our cat from diarrhea. Nevertheless, our cat was very happy with this new food and devoured all that we gave him.\n",

I do have to admit that hazelnut coffee tends to be on the light side of coffee strength so strong coffee drinkers beware! I always use the medium cup setting on the Keurig B60 special edition so if you want it stronger, use the smallest cup setting.

I bought it for those hotel room coffee makers where the packets they provide are usually old, stale, and may have been in the room with the previous 20 people who stayed in your room.  The little 4 cup coffee maker on the counter used 3 of these at a time in order to make a decently-strengthed cup of coffee.

After both my lactation consultant and my baby's pediatrician recommended fenugreek, I finally tried it.  I have worked my way up to 4 capsules, 4 times a day, plus blessed thistle, goat's rue, alfalfa and domperidone.  Only after several weeks of this combination have I finally been able to stop supplementing with formula!!  I don't know which products are doing the trick, or if they truly are each contributing, but I wouldn't stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply.  For the record, though, I started fenugreek first and noticed an increase, though it wasn't until I had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient.  I highly recommend fenugreek, and after trying several brands, I feel Nature's Way is superior to some others out there.\n",

      "Since Frisky no longer makes those great little round balls of Dental Diet cat food, I had to go looking for something else. Science Diet seemed to be the only likley alternative. My cats liked the different size and texture of the round balls but in their infinite wisdom Frisky (the nitwits) decided there wasn't a market for the product any longer. Fat lot they know. Our three cats don't love this \"dental diet cat food\" as much at the round balls but they do eat it along with their other food. I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats.\n",

I mean, it's dead, how many changes can you make to it?<br /><br />Well, darned if I have to quit the eye rolling routine from now on, because this stuff has changed how my hair looks and feels!<br /><br />I used to have long silky blonde hair. I loved it. Then I turned 40 and this evil gray curly stuff invaded my scalp. Now nearing 50, about half of my hair is still straight and fine, and the rest is grizzled and curly. It is NOT pretty.<br /><br />I did try some different products to tame the evil mass on my head, but nothing really worked, and if it did anything to the curly stuff, it made the straight stuff look like an oily mess, so I had about given up.<br /><br />Fortunately this product was offered to me through Vine, and after 2 weeks of use, I am completely amazed at how different my hair looks and feels. I can't say it's the same as it was when I was young, but the curly stuff is no longer frizzy, and the straight stuff looks good too. I can wear my hair back in a ponytail again without having the sides look like \"crazy cat lady\" by afternoon. It is wonderful!<br /><br />I don't know if it will work as well for everyone, but if you've got \"middle-aged hair problems\" I definitely recommend giving it a try!\n",

      "I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word \"magnesium\" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.\n",

Some only contained 4 or 5 pieces of candy corn.  Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.  So, if you are satisfied with a short count of skimpy treats, I suppose you might buy these, but I like a little more for my money.<br /><br />Note: Since posting this earlier review, the company seems to have corrected the shortage problem (I counted the contents of a bag purchased this year).  The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.  That compares with a different source that has packetts with about 14 pieces of candy corn (at a somewhat higher price).\n",

In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth.\n",

      "I have a cat with IBS.  While I had him on a food for sensitive stomachs, the vet recommended one that contained limited ingredients and ingredients he had not eaten before.  We went with the duck and pea canned food and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XS6RJW\">Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Limited Ingredient Diet Green Pea and Duck Formula, 10 Pound Bag</a>. The cat likes the dry cat food a great deal but the wet cat food is not his favorite.  Still, since this is all he gets now in the wet cat realm, he manages to eat it.<br /><br />Since putting him on this diet, I am not constantly cleaning up mounds of vomited food or dealing with utterly disgusting litter boxes.  He's more active and happy.  I attribute part of his new self to this food (as well as the small dose of steroids he receives each day).  As long as I feed him the right stuff and give him his medication, he is good to go.  If he sneaks into a different batch of cat food though, it is a terrible experience.<br /><br />I avoided a gradual transition to the food.  My cat's condition was getting to be so severe that I just picked a day to introduce him fully to it and he did not have any negative reactions.  In terms of consistency, I didn't find the food to be watery or dry.  There are no obvious peas or meat chunks.  It is well blended and looks like other wet cat foods I have purchased.<br /><br />I would recommend the Natural Balance line.  I would also recommend visiting your local pet food store to try out a few cans or bags of food before committing to a whole 24 cans.  Currently, my local Pet Supplies Plus has cans for about 1.38.  Petco has them for 1.58.  The price on dry cat food can be cheaper as well.<br /><br />The Natural Balance line is an investment but your cat's health and the time you save cleaning make the cost well worth it.\n",

For those of us who love the \"taste\" of the heat, but not so much of the heat itself, or those of us who can't eat jalapenos or habaneros whole from the plant, or those if us who just want a little spice, this is the perfect condiment. It does have heat, don't misunderstand me. Your nose will run and maybe even yours eyes a bit, but, it's not so hot that you really can't enjoy it.

      "It's difficult to review a product when you'd like to praise the actual product but have objections to some aspect of Amazon's sale of it. One perennial problem with Subscribe and Save grocery items is that you have no way of knowing what the item's expiration date is. In this instance, I ordered a case of Lemon Burst (package of 12) and anticipated that I would have enough for 9 months to a year. This is a potent product and you need to add only a small amount to produce a strong and vital lemon flavor. Unless you're making food for a restaurant, it's hard to imagine that anyone would use enough of this product to use up a pack of 12 in less time than that. If I'm wrong about this, and you're one of those who do use enormous amounts of lemon flavoring, this part of the review will not apply to you. For the rest of you, here is my experience. I ordered the package of 12 in mid-May of 2012. The expiration date on the individual containers is mid-October 2012, giving me less than 6 months in which to use up the 12 containers. If I'd known this, I would not have ordered, since I couldn't possibly use that amount in less than six months. I've had the same issue on occasion (and seen it commented on by others) with grocery items in bulk, such as mayonnaise, where the product was close to the expiration date when it arrived. I suppose there are people who could use six large jars of mayo in a month or so, but if you are not one of them, beware ordering time-sensitive products through Subscribe and Save. In any event, the vendor should be required to state the expiration date so that the buyer has the needed information to decide for himself or herself whether to order.<br /><br />I've used this product for some time, long before I bought it from Amazon, and have used it in everything where you might possibly use lemon juice (including a squirt in iced tea). It's pure lemon juice and oil of lemon, unadulterated in any way, and has a potent true lemon flavor. I believe I've tried every such product on the market, and this is by far the best; it exists in an entirely different universe from *Real*Lemon, nor should it be confused with supermarket lemon juices that come in a similar container but bear no resemblance whatsoever to this pure and natural product. If you're uncertain about buying large quantities of a product you may not have tried before, this item is usually easily found in health food stores and co-ops, where you can buy a single one and give it a try. As there are also some reports of allergic reactions to lemon juice due to factors that might not be disclosed on this site, it's always good to look at the actual ingredient list printed on the product.\n",

She also had constant dried sleep in her eyes; I'd wash her face every day. My other dog would scratch herself constantly with her back legs. My vet recommended Science Plan or some such kibble designed for dogs with sensitive skin. I asked why the normal kibble they sold would aggravate it. No answer. And clearly--- it's time for a change.<br />I love Amazon and that I could find this food. Talk about a 180. They LOVE this food. They can't wait to eat (they both sit and squeak if I'm even 10 mins late with it- they used to look at me with total nonchalance when I put the kibble down)and my littlest one has put on nearly 2lbs which she desperately needed. They are both healthier, happier dogs. No more skin scratching! No more eye goop. I mix it with ground turkey or chicken breasts. Also eggs are awesome with it and they love them.<br />God knows what goes into kibble. I would NEVER feed it to an animal again. Vets who shill that stuff should be ashamed.\n",

I don't like to use half and half and definitely don't like the powdered stuff. This travels very well.  I can even carry some with me to use for creamer at dunkin donuts.

It's light, vegetal and very smooth.  To get the full flavor you need to use more leaves than most other green teas, and make sure the water temperature doesn't go over 180 degrees.  I often mix this tea with cascade mint, jasmine green or other Stash loose leaf herbal teas because although it's very good by itself, plain green tea can get boring day-after-day.  Contrary to the other reviewer, I don't like the Stash Organic Pinhead Gunpowder, and recommend this tea instead.\n",

This definitely did the trick. Described, it is the closest thing to wet cat food protein content in a dry food. It also smells, not like wet cat food, but definitely has a raw fishy smell to it, not exactly pleasant. However, they love it, and we haven't had a problem since.

      "The flavor name of this \"The Switch\" drink is \"Watermelon Strawberry.\"  I thought there was a law in what you put for the beginning names of a flavor -- it is supposed to be the main ingredient by weight.  For example in a soup named Beef Vegetable the ingredient of Beef must be listed as one of the first ingredients in the soup, not \"potatoes, carrots, etc.\"  In this case the first ingredients are \"100% juice\" reconstituted with \"filtered sparkling water\" of the following juice concentrates: \"Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon.\"  Note that Watermelon and Strawberry are listed last and next to last among the fruit juice concentrates.<br /><br />I think the drink tastes too strong and the carbonation is too strong.  Even after adding ice AND letting it become diluted, the flavor is too strong.  Now that would be a good thing if I liked the flavor but I do not.  I have tried one other flavor, the Kiwi Berry and it is also like this as well -- too strong.<br /><br />AND like I said on the other review, I think it would make a good base for an ice cream punch bowl drink. A lot of vanilla ice cream would help. Would not buy it for a regular thirst quenching drink.<br /><br />140 calories for 8.3 oz. including 36 carbs (35g. sugar), 15mg. sodium, 100% daily allowance of Vitamin C.\n",

They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.\n",

      "Ok, I have to admit I was a little intrigued by the concept of this candy.  Well sorta candy, I'm not sure what you would classify this product as.  It claimed to give you energy and it was made of honey, that's actually pretty neat and healthy sounding.  That being said, there were a few things that just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />The drop is basically a hard candy coating wrapped around liquid honey, or what I'm assuming is the honey in the product.  This honey has a very sweet medicinal taste to it and the outside coating is exactly like a hard candy.  Right down to the stick on your teeth and be impossible to get off aspect.  The inside did taste better than the outside coating and had a lot richer flavor to it.  But alas, that sensation didn't last very long as there wasn't very much in there.<br /><br />I didn't experience any uplift in energy at all from this product.  But I did find it good as a sort of cough drop.  It definitely eased my coughing back when I had a cold.  This product also dissolved pretty well into hot tea to help soothe the throat that way too.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the ingredients lift.  Corn syrup was featured pretty prominently with honey coming in listed after that.  So there wasn't as much honey as there could have been in this product.  But it also had some vitamins thrown in and the ingredient list wasn't that large.  So it came out ok all in all.<br /><br />I don't see myself getting this product too much unless I'm sick.  Its ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011\n",

      "Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!\n",

Next, I started feeling warm, my stomach was cramping, and I was puking.  I never get sick like this!!  I tried to call my doctor, but they were closed.  Thought I was going to die.\n",

There are far better chips available here for just a little more money (when you take advantage of sales and discounts).\n",

      "I received this olive oil a few months ago and i have been using it for alot<br />of different things. from salads and marinades and cooking, to just dipping bread in it.<br />This olive oil is absolutely amazing...upon opening the bottle for the first<br />time, i must say that it was an experience!!When you open this bottle for the first time...<br />the aroma hits you like a runaway freight train. I personally have never encountered<br />olive oil of this caliber. This was obviously a true labor of love. The cold<br />press date is on the bottle and this batch was cold pressed in november of 2010,<br />so it is definately VERY fresh. I cannot recommend this product enough!!<br /> I have tried many different olive oils and pretty much most if not all of<br />the ones i see in stores never have the cold press date on them and if they<br />do, its like 2 years old..rediculous...these people are proud of what they do and<br />it shows in the fact that they clearly list the cold press date right on the bottle.<br /> and the pressing of this is only about 6-7 months old..amazing.<br />One last thing...When i recieved this bottle of olive oil it was packaged in<br />a box...and the bottle is a dark DARK green, which says to me that they<br />have also packaged this oil correctly..ie..it was probably immediately packaged<br />in the box to keep sunlight away from it! and also the bottle color is correct..<br />olive oil's main enemy is sunlight...<br /> So all that being said...it is amazing..buy it...you will not be disapointed!\n",

      "This Chai hits the spot perfectly and for a great cost combined with the simplicity of only needing to add water.  Yes, I will admit it is not as smooth as a Starbucks Chai Latte if you just make it like I do with nothing but hot water and no frother, etc.  However, for how easy it is to make, how cheap it is overall, and how quickly Amazon gets this to me, I will take this any day of the week.  I have saved soooo much money already from drinking this instead of my daily habit of visiting Starbucks previously.<br /><br />For those wary of buying in bulk like this, it is well worth it, and trust me you will drink it.  I have gone through 4 cans already and am about to order my next 2 cans.  I keep one at home, and one at work.  Never know when you need that Chai fix ;).  The flavor is perfect for me; it has the right amount of spices and a pretty creamy taste for being a powder mix (much better than most hot chocolate/etc mixes in terms of smoothness).  I am tempted to try the other varieties that Big Train sells as well now... like Vanilla.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this product, and will continue to order it as long as they sell it.  5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up!\n",

Sunglasses drawn, you sip your cool, pineapple-laced mai tai enjoying every gulp as it refreshes your dry, parched mouth.  A cool breeze brushes past as if nature's hand itself wanted to rock you gently as you would a baby in its cradle.  The soft crashes of ocean waves against the white sandy beach beckons you for a short dip in the cool, clear waters of Hanauma Bay.

You open your eyes to find a beautiful island girl dressed in her native garb of Hawaiian grass skirt, coconut shell top and aromatic lei around her neck and forehead.  She greets you with her pearly white smile that shines in contrast against her perfectly tanned, soft skin.  Surely, no mortal deserve such perfection.  She reaches over for a chocolate covered macadamia nut and motions toward you to place one of these little pieces of heaven in your salivating mouth.  Just when the tip of your tongue senses the sweetness of milk chocolate ---<br /><br />SLAP!!!!<br /><br />Inexplicably, your horrible boss appears before you with his arms belligerently crossed against his chest yelling at the top of his lungs, demanding to know where his TPS reports are as he is already 5 minutes late with his appointment with the \"Bobs\" in the meeting room.  He storms out of your cubicle while contentiously muttering the words, \"We'll talk about this later, mmmmkay?\"<br /><br />Suddenly, the reality surrounds you like a cheap wet suit as a co-worker passes by insisting you have a bad case of the \"Mun-days.\"  Dejected, you sit back down in your office-appointed chair and reach out for a macadamia nut chocolate and realize this candy is the closest you'll ever get to Hawaii.<br /><br />Sigh...\n",

      "I was disappointed. My darling child has been diagnosed gluten intolerant, so I bought her cookie mix. This mix is made from sweet brown rice flour, which makes them VERY gritty -- like they have sand in them. Also, it gives the cookies a weird flavor -- kind of plasticky.<br /><br />My sweet child won't eat them because of the texture, so it's useless to me.

We froze most, and she's scarfing them from the freezer!!<br /><br />I suppose that, if the texture wasn't as big of a deal to someone, this'd be a pretty good quick treat.\n",

      "This is great wake up coffee yes it is bitter but what serious wake up coffee<br />is not? I found the best way to deal with that is to mix it with a french vanilla or toffee k-cup<br />to bring down the bitterness and add coffee mate french vanilla creamer I keep adding the creamer  until the bitter is<br />gone and what you end up with after is this a great tasting coffee that wakes you up even if you did not sleep much<br />i find this cup of coffee has that punch when you need a punch in the face to wake up I don't use it every day<br />but the days that i am dragging and want the day to end this is the antidote for those kind of i want sleep but a can't days<br />and there is just to much to do and no energy to do it days so if you are one of those that needs more energy or likes strong coffee<br />this k-cup is for you! you can't go wrong hope this was a help thanks for ready Mike!\n",

      "I got my kitten through a rescue group when he was about 7 months old. He had been a stray and was very thin, had bad breath, diarrhea, poor coat and missing hair on his ears. He has been on this Natural Balance dry food for the last seven months or so and he's now a very healthy 14 pounds, has a gorgeous shiny coat, no diarrhea, his breath is good and has a great energy level. It's hard to believe he's the same cat. I'm very happy with this food and so is he. He loves the taste and never gets tired of it. Yes, it's a little more costly than buying the generic brand of cat food at the grocery store but I save on vet bills because my cat is never sick. I have tried other brands of food, but he prefers the taste of this one and I'm happy he's doing so well on it.\n",

I use it in scrambled eggs every morning. It absolutely beats every other lemon-pepper I've tried in many years of cooking.  It's even great in soups, on buttered toast and baked potatoes, in cottage cheese, rice etc.  In addition, use in to enhance traditional chicken, fish and beef recipes.

      "OK, so I couldn't personally taste this cat food and give you a review. But all I can say is: my two cats (14 and 15 years old) virtually inhaled it. Clawdette is the older one and she is fussy. She likes a cat food that has seafood and tomato in it. Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes. The bottom line: they loved it, it left their coats nice and softy and glossy, and they had lots of energy. So I (or, rather my cats) give it five stars.\n",

      "This coconut butter's quality is very consistently high (across the 3 bottles I've used).<br /><br />It will turn solid during cooler temps, and will need to be scraped with a spoon. In summer it turns to liquid, and the oil separates and floats on top. I recommend stirring thoroughly before each use, if it's watery enough.<br /><br />The taste? Sublime. There is a strong pleasant aroma of coconuts when I bring the bottle close. I eat 1-2 teaspoons per day (not mixed with anything else), and each time it captivates my taste buds and won't let turn my attention to anything else until I've licked the spoon clean. It helps me snap out of morning grogginess, and I think my mood actually improves. The taste is also faintly sweet, but not overly so; if you prefer sweet foods, this might be bland to you.<br /><br />There is a slight grainy-ness in liquid form, even after stirring, but I have no problem with that. It's thick and viscous so you probably want to give your saliva time to work on it before you swallow. I find that I can't eat too much in one sitting. Maybe because it's so satisfying (or maybe because in the back of my mind, I recall how much I'm spending for this stuff).<br /><br />I've noticed a slight laxative effect; perhaps it's due to the high fiber content. I've read a couple online forums that advise adding a little lime to avoid this. I have no idea whether this works.<br /><br />Coconut is allegedly very good for your health, containing the medium-chain fatty acid, lauric acid.

      "This is the BEST gum I have ever chewed...great long lasting peppermint flavor... not too strong... just the right amount of sweetness that freshens your mouth. Once I start chewing this gum....its hard to resist the urge to chew another one.<br /><br />A WORD OF CAUTION - most sugar free gums have sorbitol and aspartame which are harmful if consumed in large quantities. Google \"sorbitol\" and \"aspartame\" and read the harmful effects yourself. So I would suggest to consume this gum in limited quantities and only after going through the ingredients.<br /><br />But other than this, I love this gum and have run out of the pack of 20 I purchased from Amazon subscribe and save at a cheaper price. However, I was a bit disappointed since Amazon cancelled my next Subscribe and Save shipment stating they are out of this gum and then bumping up the price by $3. But it would be unfair to give this gum anything less that 5 stars as it really awesome compared to some of the other gums I have chewed before.\n",

This is the only toy that has lasted.  He ripped the rope off after a few days, but this toy is still perfect.  He gets bored eating out of his bowl so now he plays with this and it's the only way he eats his food.  We put his alloted kibble and some smelly treats and he can play with it all day.

They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good.

A couple of years ago she started vomiting after meals about once a week.  The vet said there was nothing wrong and she was probably just eating too fast.  We immediately switched over to this Sensitive Stomach version and the vomiting frequency decreased dramatically.  Now she vomits only once every two or three months.  I'm skeptical that there is anything really different about this food, and it could have just been a coincidence that she stopped vomiting after we switched.  Still, I'd rather just stick with this kind than find out.  I took away one star because it is, in my opinion, unreasonably expensive.\n",

      "This is a solid tea a bit stronger than most but hardly up there with the powerhouse sort of teas. I prefer a strong tea such as Twinings Irish Breakfast or Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold. This tea is a bit more complex than most others but in the few cups I've tasted, it doesn't seem consistent. I tend to steep my tea longer than usually recommended which I find imperative here to get the full flavor. No 3 minute steeps here or you'll surely find the tea weaker than it should be.<br /><br />The inconsistency is in flavor. Some cups have had a fruity slightly citrus complexity to them while others miss that.<br /><br />As a note, I drink my tea with nothing added using purified water as a base. The box states that this tea stands up well to use with milk and sugar. I think you'd end up with a candy-like confection adding those two but it's your choice, I suppose.<br /><br />The tea comes in individually foil wrapped bags and each bag has a string attached which is something I infer the British tea drinkers find redundant. Anyway, the foil wrap should guarantee fresh flavor which leaves me baffled at the somewhat inconsistent flavor between cups.\n",

I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.\n",

      "If asked to sum up this coffee-pod drawer in one word, \"sturdy\" would be my enthusiastic answer. It is one hefty piece of metal sliding-drawer perfection - it weighed in at 4 lbs. 11 oz. on my postal scale!<br /><br />The drawers slide in and out with barely a hitch. Large rubber feet on the bottom means it stays put on your counter. The drawers have stops on the bottom so you won't accidentally pull  them out completely. And best of all, 36 K-cups fit in perfectly, nestling cozily in 3 individual rows per drawer thanks to 2 divider bars in each.<br /><br />Seriously, you can't go wrong with this product if you have only a couple of boxes of K-cups you need to store. So much more attractive than boxes! I do plan to eventually paint mine with metal spray-paint to complement my kitchen's color scheme.\n",

I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free.

      "Before I go any further in this review, I have to admit that I initially didn't know that this came in pods when I requested it. For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a \"pot\" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole \"organic, fair trade\" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)\n",

      "My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review\n",

      "My 8 year old cat is one of the fussiest eaters on the planet. She will not even touch a food if she sniffs it and decides she doesn't like the smell of it. I have tried the tactic of just leaving it out and not giving her any other options for food and she just ends up starving. She has been eating a cheap brand of dry cat food with ingredients that I now know are just horrific for cats her whole life. The first five ingredients were brewer's rice, chicken by-product meal, corn meal, chicken fat and soybean meal. As you can probably see, this is a food I was desperate to get her off of. She has also been a very skittish cat and would often have anxiety attacks about seemingly nothing. Like, at the very slightest noise she would literally jump 4 feet in the air from fear and if you were near her or touching her when it happened she would unintentionally scratch you to ribbons in her mad dash to get away. I was sad when this happened because normally she is such a gentle cat and has never bit me in her life, there is no way she would scratch unless she was terrified and completely out of her mind. I had an inkling that the junk food might be exacerbating this problem, much like how gluten and dairy could exacerbate the problems of autistic children.<br /><br />All of my attempts up until now have ended up in failed attempts and money wasted on food she wouldn't eat. This happened again and again and I almost thought it was a lost cause until Holistic Select chicken meal formula. We recently rescued a kitten off the streets and I knew I didn't want to start feeding her the same junk that my older cat had been eating for years. I was looking up some grain-free formulas and decided to go with one of those brands since cats shouldn't really be eating grains. To make a long story short, both the kitten and cat didn't like it. The kitten will nibble on it if there are no other options (she's easier to please, thank goodness), so I've kept it around and leave it out so there's something out when their other food is gone, but all in all, not a success by any means. I had a sample packet of Holistic Select chicken meal lying around that I received probably about a year ago and never got around to giving to my cat and the kitten got at it and bit away at the packaging to get the food inside. I looked at the ingredient list and hey, not too bad! I hoped beyond hope and offered some to my older cat and she eagerly ate it! Hallelujah!<br /><br />So I quickly bought a bag from Amazon and prayed that she would continue eating it. Well, I am now down to a quarter of the bag and I recently had to reorder. Both of the cats eat it with no problems and my older cat actually has far less anxiety attacks. She seems much more calm and is now willing to let my husband come up to her without running away in fear. He can even pet her a little. This is a miraculous change than just a few months ago when the mere sight of him had her diving under the bed. I have recently been eating healthier and I know what a difference it makes for me and there is no difference with our pets. What we feed them has a drastic affect on their well-being and behavior. This is not the absolute best food out there, but it's pretty darn good. I have recently ordered some wet food cans from Holistic Select since I know little kitten will go crazy over that and it's good to supplement the diet with some wet.\n",

      "With granola, it's usually a trade-off between taste and health, and Back to Nature Chocolate Delight is no exception, delivering only moderately on both counts.<br /><br />By using different kinds of sugars, the ingredient label looks better, but added up, it's still a lot of sugar.  With 13g of sugar per 50g (1/2 cup), this granola is almost one-fourth sugar:  evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, molasses, sugar, and dextrose.  Back to Nature isn't the worst in this regard, but if you want to minimize your sugar intake (and everyone should, of course), be aware of what you're eating.<br /><br />The fat content is also moderate for a granola, 6g in the form of safflower oil.<br /><br />The taste is okay; I didn't find it to be outstanding.  And the granola pieces are extremely hard and overly crunchy (which I didn't like).  However, my eight-year-old daughter loved this granola and would be delighted if I got it all the time (the chocolate chips, though not particularly tasty, in my opinion, were a big hit with her).<br /><br />This granola is worth trying if it sounds like it might suit your preferences, but try to get a single pack of it from a local store to try before committing to a big multipack.\n",

Then Grill them. The steaks come out REALLY good. I don't even use Steak sauce with them. They taste too good to muddle up with a sauce. I have used this many, many other ways.

      "Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />1st Vegetable Starter Kit<br />If you're like me trying to decide what flavor to give your baby the first time can be difficult. I had an idea because of going through this with my son, but my daughter (as it turns out) has completely different likes and dislikes. This variety comes with sweet potatoes, carrots and peas. As it turns out my daughter can't stand peas and the nice thing is we only have 2 jars left over instead of quite a bit more potentially. It's pretty basic and on a whole I think most babies like all of these, but you just never know. That's why I like it in this kit. You can try them out without having to hand pick and sort through a bunch at the store. It takes the guessing out of it. Yes, the price is a little high, but if you just need something to get you started it's great!\n",

I used to like \"Pop Tarts\" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.\n",

The plastic is not as pleasing aesthetically as I have many flavors on display for a \"soda bar\".  I have not noticed a difference in taste, but it makes me wonder if that changes over time.\n",

      "As some background, I should disclose that I regularly use Splenda -- most frequently in plain greek yogurt, either mixed in with some fruit or some other flavoring such as vanilla beans.  In the past I have regularly used Nutrasweet.  I have tried Stevia but I found that I did not like its aftertaste.  I never warmed to saccharine because of its bad aftertaste, too.  I have used Splenda blends in baking with good results as well, though I seldom bake any sweets any more due to dietary reasons.<br /><br />What I liked about Nectresse was that it didn't seem to add any flavor to my yogurt beyond sweetness.  I detected no aftertaste at all, and the sweetness itself was fairly mild.  By comparison, the same amount of Splenda (one packet per 8 ounces of yogurt) has a higher level of sweetness.<br /><br />Just to confirm my perceptions, I decided to taste both Nectresse and Splenda by themselves.  In this taste test, I again found Nectresse to have a slightly lower level of sweetness.  Nectresse looks a bit more like sugar -- small grains versus fine white powder.  Beyond the different appearance and slightly different intensity level, the products were nearly identical in that they both taste clean with a hint of an aftertaste that is apparent when consumed alone but is masked when used as they normally would be -- mixed with other ingredients.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to debate how natural this product is.  In addition to the hyped monk fruit extract, it also contains erythritol, sugar, and molasses.  In fact, erythritol is the first ingredient listed, so I assume that means that the product, by weight, contains more of that than the other ingredients.  According to what I read online, erythritol is much less likely to cause intestinal discomfort than other sugar alcohols because it is largely absorbed in the small intestine.  I've never been bothered by any sugar alcohol in this regard, however, except on the lone unfortunate occasion when I consumed WAY too much sugar-free chocolate and had a regretful afternoon.\n",

I love this tea and drink it all the time. Often I brew a mixed pot with the Ahmad Early Grey and another type of tea, like Ahmad No. 1 Breakfast (also very good) or just a Lipton Black Tea bag. It also works great when used alongside any Turkish black tea. This triple pack of 100 bags that Amazon sells is the most economical way of buying this tea, especially when you sign up for the subscription and get a 15% discount with free shipping on your order.

When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy\n",

First, it looks like somebody just swept their arm across a shelf and dumped a bunch of random stuff in a box. I shouldn't gripe that much about packaging, BUT, as I was unpacking them and putting them away, I noticed that both of the pods from Grove square seemed a bit lite. I shook them around and they sounded empty. I opened them up to see if they were empty, and, well, you can see from my pictures what was in them. One of them looked like it had already been run through a brew cycle and then left to mold in the sun. The second one, again as you can see in the picture, was pretty much empty except for what looked like a moldy piece of pocket lint. Keep in mind that both of these pods were sealed airtight when I got them. I guess I need to blame the maker of the pods, but this is just not acceptable.<br /><br />I think it is safe to say I WILL NOT EVER be buying anything like this again and would highly advise others to look elsewhere as well\n",

This is not a product to \"lose weight\".  There are other products you can use of real peanut butter for that.  This product is designed for those of us who have restrictions due to diabeties or gluten related issues.  I have to watch my carbs and sugars very carefully and saw this as a great alternative on a diabetic store sight.  I tried it with the grape spread.  The two together are not bad.  On bread, it is alot like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.  But without the carbs, sugars and fat associated with it.  The taste is not bad, it is actually alot like a whipped mousse.  The grape spread was good with it.  Will I buy it again?  Probably, unless I find something the same that is better.<br />Do not always follow the reviews, most people have too high of expectations when they buy foods like these.

      "Hopefully you're not imagining that these cookies might be as good as home made.  Of course they're not.  They're  mass-produced, very sweet cookies that are fall-apart-in-your-hand soft and only slightly chewy, with a creamy--not fudgey--center. It's not as though you can't find really tasty, quality cookies in a package at the supermarket, but these are not first-class cookies even on the scale of what the big companies crank out by the millions. For example, Pepperidge Farm's soft-baked Captiva and Chocolate Chunk cookies are very similar in concept, but superior.<br /><br />The word \"fudge\"--let alone \"Megafudge\"--may conjure up Willie Wonka-like fantasies, or have you thinking you'll be biting into a big block of deep, dark chocolate fudge.  No, no, no. They're chocolate alright, but they look and sound a lot more chocolatey than they taste--not the kind you get from a bar of dark chocolate or premium chocolate ice cream, let alone fudge, but a disappointing, how-can-something-so-dark-brown-have-so-little-chocolate-flavor kind of taste. I can picture these being formulated in a lab by men in white coats, using jars of brown and white powders and syrups in test tubes. That kind of \"chocolate.\" Those reviewers who squeal that these have a rich chocolate flavor sadly don't know what they're missing.  They're also smaller than I expected; maybe two inches in diameter, not the sort of three- or four-inch disks you'd likely find in a bakery (or the Pepperidge Farm varieties), or would make at home; you'll need two or three just to feel like you've eaten something.<br /><br />If you put some in your child's lunch, will he or she like them?  Why not--he or she will likely be enjoying the sugar rush for an hour before falling asleep.  If you sit down in front of the TV with them can you eat ten of them before you know it?  Sure.

      "I made this in a regular coffee maker made for pods.<br />I thought it was find - it reminded me most of a breakfast blend.  It was very smooth with what seemed like a normal dose of caffeine.  It's not at all bitter - unfortunately, around here, we LIKE bitter in our beer and coffee, so I probably would not buy it again.  If, however, you like something like Maxwell House Breakfast Blend with a mild flavor, but a bit more caffeine, you'll probably really like it.<br />I love that it is fair trade.

      "Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.\n",

      "So about a year and a half ago I finally started changing my eating habits. Including cutting out the junk food. I was rewarded with a 160lb reduction in my weight, I have about 50 more to lose. And I was able to get off my medication for High blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Which are both now controlled just with diet and exercise alone.<br />Still, I haven't lost my sweet tooth and so finding ways to satisfy it while maintaining my good eating habits is a must. One of the things I like to have once in while is low fat popcorn like this. I don't eat it too often because of the salt but it's great for those times that snacking urge is undeniable! I've had other brands of kettle corn but this one is pretty good, if not the best. I also like that the whole bag which is the large kind is only about 100 calories. So no guilt if you eat more than your fair share. ^_^<br />Other brands I've had were only half this size but had the same amount of calories.<br /><br />Great tasting popcorn, great size!\n",

      "I've given up on cows milk products....it interferes with my digestion, creates constipation and gas.  I decided to try this powdered goats milk because I remembered that my parents told me that I was allergic to cows milk when I was a baby and they gave me goats milk instead, but then switched me to cows milk when I was old enough to tolerate it.  I wish they had left me on the goats milk growing up because I find that my body tolerates it much better, and I think I would have been healthier as a child growing up if I'd had goats milk instead of cows milk.<br /><br />I use it to make my own kefir, yogurt, custards and whatever else I need milk for.  I was a bit dubious when I first bought it....I didn't know if I would like the taste of it or not, but....I love the taste and the smell of it.  Mmmmmm.....Yum. The taste at first reminded me a tiny bit of the flavor of lamb.....and I love lamb....but this taste is so slight that it's not noticable in kefir (which makes the most delicious pancakes), or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods.  I like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk.<br /><br />I also like the powdered milk because I can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time, as I need it, and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or spoiling.  It's very convenient.<br /><br />It takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it, but once it is all dissolved in the water, I can't tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk.  It dissolves and mixes quickest in a blender.\n",

      "My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.\n",

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"bowel tolerance\" or \"happy bowels\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.

      "Mrs. Boilermate is from the Philadelphia area. One of the local treats there is Ivins Spiced Wafers, a ginger snap-like cookie that seems to evoke a \"love 'em\" or \"hate 'um\" reaction. Personally I love the crisp cookie and the fairly strong spice flavor. Other family members, however, call them \"hockey pucks.\"<br /><br />Before ordering these from Vine I scanned the early reviews, and saw a similar trend. Now that I've tried them, I come down on the \"love 'em\" side. These are an adult cookie and would go well with a cup of tea.<br /><br />I like the crisp texture and the prominent, but not overpowering, ginger flavor. These cookies have tiny bits of candied ginger mixed in. This is a bit of a two-edged sword. While they contribute to the prominent ginger flavor, they are also gummy and stick to my teeth, hence the four-star rating. I did not detect any aftertaste.<br /><br />I can't comment on the effectiveness of the peel-and-stick tab for resealing the bag...I never needed it.<br /><br />I have been a \"fan\" of Newman's Own products for years and these cookies have done nothing to change that. Newman's is proof you can have an ethical business model and still be successful.<br /><br />Bottom line: I will buy these when they hit the stores here.\n",

LOL It is also good mixed with orange juice and coconut water...it's a little bit artificial tasting, but not overly in my opinion...it's like drinking the light syrup out of a can of pineapple. It's an awesome buy in my humble opinion because each \"bag\" makes a LOT of Zuko. I keep this in the pantry and sometimes mix it with the Jama flavor (hisbiscus flower flavor, and excellent!) and serve it over crushed ice. It's awesome. It's also shelf-stable. If you keep some in your pantry, you'll always have something good to drink (or mix with your spirits.)\n",

In fact, my college-aged son says he prefers these over the greasy regular potato chip.  With 65% less fat and baked, they are a healthy alternative to regular potato chips.  We got the lightly salted because husband is watching his blood pressure and these are perfect with just a touch of sea salt on them.  Sodium is lower than Lays baked and the taste is much better.

      "This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.<br /><br />First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.<br /><br />I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to \"just have one.\"  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.<br /><br />I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.<br /><br />I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.<br /><br />I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.<br /><br />I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to \"get my fix\" again.<br /><br />I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.  I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour.<br /><br />And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.

Nothing beats it. It's also good on tenderloin, ribeye, or filet mignon,  but if the meat is top quality, you want to taste the meat, not the sauce.<br /><br />A1 is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip. I especially like it on 95% lean ground sirloin burgers. The leaner the meat, the more you need a little something else to give it some zip. Ketchup gets the job done, but A1 is a nice detour from the ordinary.\n",

I wouldn't say that it's my favorite oatmeal cookie ever, but I would be very okay with eating more of them  :)\n",

      "I too did my research before buying this product for my dogs.  I was a little nervous about buying a Diamond product after their prior toxic mold recall, but I thought that this company would be the most diligent after an event like that.  The dogs like it, I liked the price, the free shipping was good too.  But, the PRICE has crept up $12 on Amazon in 3 months!  And, now the company is in the midst of yet another recall.  I was going to start looking around again for something new due to the price hike, but now I definitely will due to the recall.  I have lost faith in this company.  I may try something local like Blue Seal feeds as they've never had a recall.  In trying to find an optimum food for my dogs, I'll probably end up killing them with kindness with these recalls.  I think I'm ready to give a locally produced feed that's been around forever a try.\n",

      "I drink quite a bit of Tazo Thrive and Tazo Zen green teas.  Tazo Thrive is a nice mix of green tea, mate, and various botanicals.  My liking for this tea got me to try Mate.  I actually first tried a bottled version of unsweetened Guayaki Yerba Mate, which I like very much -- I always keep some bottles in my fridge in case I need to grab something quick on my way out the door and don't have time to heat water for tea.<br /><br />Hot Guayaki Yerba Mate is a different taste from the cold version, but as I understand it, is the more traditional way to drink mate.  In  any event, mate is a bit of an acquired taste, and it is one that I am acquiring.  It seems to taste better (as with many teas) if the water is not too hot -- steaming a bit but short of boiling, or allowed to cool somewhat.  In addition, one can't leave the bag in too long, as with many teas, or it will become excessively bitter.  Finally, I find that adding a bit of cool water after steeping the appropriate amount of time seems to make it taste less bitter and make it easier to drink.<br /><br />In any event, mate is supposedly good for appetite suppression, disproportionate to the amount of caffeine in it.  I'm not sure it is a powerful appetite suppression -- no more than green tea, in my opinion -- but as part of a regular hydration and tea-drinking regimen can only help with controlling those urges to eat.  It is certainly an invigorating drink -- again, more than the amount of caffeine in it would promise.<br /><br />I've not tried other mate versions, but I like this one so well that I've not been interested in trying others.\n",

      "My precious young cat \"Phat Boy Cuddlecuss\" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rost. Chicken, Tender Turkey and the 2 Tuna varieties. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat.\n",

I liked the combination of sea salt and pepper; the nuts were salty without being too salty, and the pepper was just enough to be noticeable without being overpowering.  My wife thought that the sea salt and pepper would be better on a chip or something crunchier, and that the texture of the nut was jarring in combination with the seasoning.  In general, I think these are tasty nuts, and while I don't think I'd be inclined to eat these regularly, I enjoyed them.

Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with \"side effects\" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.

      "Both Jelly Belly and Heide have established themselves as leaders in the American Gummi Bear market, in fact, Jelly Belly was the first to ever make an American Gummi Bear. Unlike their European counterparts, such as Haribo Gold Bears, American Gummi Bears are soft and have a more opaque look to them.<br /><br />My all-time favorite Gummi Bear has been Heide ever since elementary school, but I give Jelly Belly a lot of credit for putting up a great fight. Jelly Belly bears are smaller and less resembling of a bear, but they sure pack a punch in terms of flavor. Heide bears on the other hand are larger and more bear-like than their counterpart, but flavor is more subtle. Both come in five distinct flavors and both are difficult to find in your average grocery store candy aisle.<br /><br />On average, Jelly Belly bears appear to be more costly than Heide bears per ounce, but of course that doesn't mean you won't find amazing deals like the one on Amazon that turn the tables. In general you won't go wrong with either brand, but my vote still goes toward Heide for bringing back all the memories of my childhood.\n",

Somehow, the little crunchy balls did not go well with the flakes - it was like I'd mixed two different cereals.  Some people may not mind that at all, I just happen to prefer the same texture in a breakfast cereal.<br /><br />I liked that the ingredients were (typical of Nature's Path) a cut above most anything found on regular grocery store shelves.  And the fact that it's organic is a huge plus.<br /><br />The subtle vanilla flavor was not overpowering, and the cereal did not require anything else on it (extra sugar, maple syrup, etc.).  I happen to use vanilla flavored almond milk, and the extra vanilla flavor was not too much.  Regardless of what it's in (milk, nut milk, soy milk, etc.), it is great all by itself.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Yes, for variety.  But I purchase several Nature's Path products in the large eco-packs to save time and packaging, and even if these become offered in the large eco-pack bags, I don't expect to be buying that much at a time.  Again - nothing at all wrong with them - actually quite good - it's just not going to be my favorite breakfast cereal.\n",

      "I discovered that long-term use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor was killing me. So I stopped. The resuting reflux was horrendous.<br /><br />I started using 2 teaspoons of Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey 30 minutes before meals. I have not needed any type of antacid. I am careful though. I don't eat known irritants like coffee, tomatoes, and chile (green or red). I stay away from all gluten containing foods - or those that might have been cross-contaminated.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey, I have broadened the types of food I eat again. The taste is good and I have learned to like the 30 minutes I wait from \"taking\" the honey until I eat. I don't use antacid. This Manuka honey is much better than proton pump inhibitors.\n",

      "I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.\n",

      "To everyone giving less stars on here for it being 'bland,' my brain is attempting not to spontaneously combust. It. Is. Oatmeal. It's not like you just went and bought a box of Lucky Charms. Do you know what else is bland? Cheerios! Doesn't make them any less amazing.<br /><br />This cereal is always exactly what I've been looking for in a cereal, something I've found almost every, single other brand, be it big label or generic lacks. It's actually filling. Sure, if you eat enough of any cereal, you'll feel full after a while, but this is the only one I've found where even a moderate bowlful leaves me feeling quite satisfied, almost like an actual bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Another good aspect is that it isn't overly sweet. And of course, it's whole grain and full of fiber, so, whee...it's even somewhat good for you.<br /><br />After having eaten cereal almost my entire childhood, I had lost the taste for it when I got older, and have, over the course of the past 15 years, not really had any interest in cereal products. However, since my 8 year old girl is a bit of a cereal aficionado and there is always random boxes of cereal in the house, I end up eating a bowl now and again. Until I discovered these. Suddenly, for the first time in a decade and a half, I'm back to a bowl of cold cereal every day for breakfast.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, you've made a breakfast cereal that I truly do enjoy.\n",

      "My son has Celiac disease and while he is not allergic to peanuts or tree nuts - his best friend is.  They sit next to each other during lunch in school, so I have to be careful to not harm his buddy with what I pack in my son's lunch.  I really think that this product is superior to the soynut butters that I find.  My family likes the taste of those, but I'm not comfortable adding an abundance of soy to my family's diet.<br /><br />My son has had absolutely no complaints with this.  He even asks for it at home when regular peanut butter is an option for him.  I wish I would have looked for this on Amazon sooner because they have a better deal than what I can find in my local stores.  I think that if more people would be aware of this product, more schools would agree to implement school-wide peanut free policies if they have peanut-allergic students.  (In fact, I think I'm going to point this product out to my son's school.)<br /><br />It doesn't taste like peanut butter - but it is still very good.  It tastes just like sunflower seeds.  The texture is similar to some organic peanut butters.  It's not quite as thick as Jif or Skippy and is a little oily.  It spreads on easily - which is something that I'm extremely happy about being that gluten free bread is so crumbly.  While I haven't gone crazy in using this in baking recipes, it has worked for the ones that I did try.<br /><br />I can't really comment on how long this product lasts.  I keep it in the refrigerator and we usually use it up within a few weeks.  While I realize that I've never had an open jar all that long, it never did taste rancid or off during that time.\n",

This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors -- it's just nice and peanutty.<br /><br />I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.  They both have a strong peanutty flavor.  I think I will stick with just this plain version if I order it again.\n",

I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.\n",

      "I have a 7 yr old Pom who has been on Rachel Ray's Weight Control food and green beans for 4 months and he lost his 2 extra pounds and is very healthy. The bag weighs more than he does. He knew it was his right off. I gave him a little handful while I read about the ingredients and how much to feed him. I was a bit shocked when I read the label of ingredients..the highest amount is always listed first. I expected beef or carrots no it is ground yellow corn meal, chicken by product meal, corn glutton, whole wheat flour animal fat, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol meat and bone meal.Then tons of chemical additives, some dried corn and carrots. This is a semi soft food dogs love, no wonder just like people what tastes so good is usually bad for us. When I adopted the dog he was on another semi-soft that really is not to healthy so I switched him to Iam's Proactive. He did well on that but started to gain some weight.<br /><br />I'm sorry I didn't check the ingredients before orderings. The picture looks so healthy great balanced nutrition. Think we will stay with Rachel Ray's healthy weight food, it doesn't have all these additives. Just meat and veggies. Beneful is a misleading name.<br /><br />It can be given in small amounts I think as a treat.\n",

      "This is the best Cajun spice my wife and I have found anywhere, ever.  We have been using it for more than ten years.  It goes great on all sorts of things -- chicken, beef, pork, fish, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, or fried), baked potato, etc.  Not only is it a very good combination of spices, it is also ground fine and mixed well.  Whenever we fry something in batter or breading, Luzianne's Cajun Seasoning usually finds its way into the mix.<br /><br />We've tried \"Slap Ya Momma\" and other cajun spices, but those tend to be too coarse.  Instead of tasting a blend of spices, you tend to bite down on a nugget of salt, filling your mouth with the taste of salt, then a nugget of pepper, filling your mouth with the taste of pepper, etc.  Luzianne's is definitely the superior implementation.<br /><br />We recently ran out of it, and to our dismay Safeway has stopped carrying this product, which is why we have tried other brands.  None have measured up, which is why I was searching for it online.  We're very happy to have found it again on Amazon.\n",

It's vitamin enriched, heavily, according to the label.<br /><br />I added a quarter cup of shaved almonds and a scoop of whey protein and it was quite good.

      "When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I usually choose flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 140 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 36 grams - plus 35 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />This flavor of Switch does have a higher calorie count than<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40\">The Switch Kiwi Berry</a> - though I'm not sure why.<br /><br />Taste: This drink has the unique taste of strawberries, grapes and watermelon at the same time. My spouse said it tasted like \"watermelon bubble gum\". Anyone looking to get off the soda kick can find a nice change of pace with this juice. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to \"make the switch\" for two main reasons:<br /><br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.\n",

As long as the fold is creased well (such as running a fingernail over the crease), the fold stays shut.  Even better, make a well creased fold across the top and then fold in the corners a bit too.  I like that they are unbleached and better for the environment than plastic baggies - especially for an item that is usually used just once and then thrown away.

      "Sumac is not in every kitchen cupboard, but it should be.  A lot like lemon, tart and astringent, but somehow moreso, it brings out other flavors and enhances them. Makes them more intense.  Sprinkle equal parts sumac, thyme and salt (the blend is called zaatar and used a lot in middle eastern cooking) on chicken before roasting and broiling and it brings out all the chicken flavor with just a hint of tanginess.<br /><br />One half a teaspoon sprinkled on scrambled eggs lifts them out of the category of breakfast standby and into a completely new echelon.  The pairing of smoked fish (lox or salmon, whitefish, sable or, especially, sturgeon) with sumac-enhanced scrambled eggs does things to the inside of the mouth that are probably illegal in some Red States.<br /><br />Run of the mill red caviar can be mixed with sour cream, a tiny amount of finely chopped chives and a big hit of sumac, then spread on a halved fingerling potatoes that have been sliced in half, drizzled with lots of olive oil and oven roasted until they have a good, crunchy crust. It's a combination of flavors and textures that's explodes with bright flavor. If you can never get too much salt, scatter some crisp bacon on top.  It's really salty, but really delicious.<br /><br />Any food that benefits from a squirt of lemon will be better with a little sumac.  Even lemonade is improved, especially if your lemons are dull and you want a really tart beverage.  Melt 1/2 cup sugar in hot water, pour it into a big pitcher. Add one teaspoon sumac, 1/4 tsp vanilla (super secret ingredient, tell no one), the juice of 4 lemons (don't squeeze too hard, you don't want sour oils from the skin ruining the taste), and enough filtered walter to fill up the pitcher. Chill and you have the iconic summer afternoon drink.<br /><br />Sumac is perfect with fish.  Sumac and ginger rubbed onto any white fish bring out the sweetness...this is especially lovely on catfish or those new fish like tilapia that have started appearing in the markets as the really good fish disappear or become too expensive.  Sumac and garlic are a brawnier pairing, good with fish, great with vegetables.  Sautee broccoli or spinach in olive oil with garlic, then sprinkle with sumac. Even veggie haters will think twice before saying no.  And added to home fries, sumac transforms diner food into something you'll want to serve with an expensive steak.  You can also rub sumac on steak to brighten the taste or add it to your usual dry rub or marinade.  And try it in chicken soup.  Just trust me on that one...you will want to throw a parade for me after tasting.  Experiment. Keep some in a dish on the table and sprinkle wherever you might have added lemon...on salads, in salad dressings for more that sharp lemony taste but less acid.<br /><br />If you need a quick lunch, salad or appetizer, this is a fast and easy go-to dish that takes five minutes to make and will please even people who (like me) consider salads more decorative than edible.  And if someone you invite to dinner sits down at the table and drops the bomb: \"But didn't you know I'm a vegan?\" you can dash to the kitchen and have it ready to slide under that persnicity little snoot in two minutes.<br /><br />Spiced Tomatoes on Exotic Bread<br />2 Tablespoons dried thyme<br />1 Tablespoon sumac<br />2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted<br />1/2 teaspoon table salt<br />1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (or regular if you don't have the little ones. Why sweat the small stuff)<br /><br />In a small container with a lid, shake together the zaatar...thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt. If you don't have sesame seeds, it's okay. It will still taste good, just not as good.  The combination, with or without the seeds is called 'zaatar,' which is Arabic for \"Can I have some more, please.\"<br /><br />Cut each of the cherry tomatoes in half (if using whole tomatoes, dice them and let a little of the juice drain away, you don't want this too liquidy), sprinkle with about one tablespoon of the zaatar.  Stir it all together, then taste. You don't want it too salty.  Add more zaatar if necessary, tasting as you go.  The tomatoes will make this very juicy. Serve with lots of toasted naan, pita, lavash, or any middle eastern flatbread that's fun to dip/sop.  I've served it with corn tortillas and it was good. I think it would be great with toasted french bread or garlic bread.  It is so good, you forget it's made of vegetables.<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute: I forgot tunafish.  One can of tuna, one tablespoon each mayo and plain yogurt (please, not that scary plastic looking non fat stuff, use the real thing). One big tablespoon of sumac. Stir lightly so the tuna stays lumpy. Pile it on top of toasted rye bread or a rye krisp, open-faced, and scatter chives on top.  It's just tuna, takes no more time than the same old same old, but it tastes much better, plus it's festive.<br /><br />Enjoy.\n",

I'd guess that an entire bag has the equivalent of one strawberry sliced, diced, and dried. I definitely wanted more! The chocolate chunks are also tasty but sort of few and far between. The granola itself is quite good (albeit a little oatmeal-cookie sweet). But if Love Crunch is going to make chocolate and red berries so prominent on the packaging, they really should make sure that not a mouthful will go by in which you don't get at least a taste of one of those extras.

You know how some cheaper light tunas are kind of unappetizing. I don't eat a huge amount of canned tuna, but when I do, it's in a carefully constructed salad, and this tuna justifies the effort.<br /><br />The real strong point is taste. I recently tried RainCoast solid albacore. Raincoast is specifically caught AND processed in the North Pacific and Canada. I suspect Wild Planet is caught and/or processed in Southeast Asia. Both are packed in plain tuna juices. After using used to Wild Planet skipjack, I found the albacore relatively tasteless. And the Wild Planet skipjack is mostly nearly \"solid,\" close to the kind of cut you expect in \"solid\" tuna, rather than chunk. RainCoast doesn't offer any but albacore, so I'll stay with Wild Planet, currently the most environmentally attractive and well-packed product.\n",

I still enjoy Chips Ahoy!, but every time I eat them, it's never the same enjoyment I had as a kid. I guess my taste buds grew up.<br /><br />Eating Chips Ahoy Megafudge Gooey gives me the same experience. It's luscious in it's own right...the Chips Ahoy way. Chips Ahoy! Megafudge Gooey is like a chocolate chocolate-chip cookie and brownie hybrid. It eats like a soft cookie, it's tasty like a brownie, and it's fudgy goodness is a mix of both. I love the gooey fudge - that 's what really makes these cookies pop.<br /><br />As usual, these cookies taste best with milk. Kids will probably enjoy these cookies better than the adults who've tasted better and know better. However, there's just something about Chips Ahoy cookies that make you come back for more even if it's not the greatest cookie in the world. It's still Chips Ahoy! It's the familiar fun snacking cookie that even adults enjoy if you don't take your cookies and chocolate too serious.<br /><br />For Chips Ahoy! this deserves 5 stars. I think they really got something yummy here for their brand and I hope they keep it around.<br /><br />However, in comparison to other cookies out there...3 stars. Good but not great. Yummy, but you know there's better out there.\n",

      "I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first.\n",

      "I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.\n",

I have bought other brands of chopped dates countless times.<br />I bought a 4 pack of these and I do not like them.  I like many of the products this manf makes.  With prechopped dates normally the first flavor is sweet, then the date taste kicks in.  With these the first flavor is oat, they are hardley sweet and have almost no date flavor.  The limited flavor they will add are not worth the extra calories (dates are high in sugar so 1/3 cup has 130 calories).<br />These chopped dates are coated in oat flour so they do not stick.  Other manf use some sort of sugar.  The oat seemed like a great idea. I planned on baking cookies and muffins with these so the oat taste would have been okay if there also was a sweet date taste.<br />The very small amount of oat flour did not change the consistancy.<br />Maybe I just got a bad batch of no-flavor dates but I would expect the manf quality control to prevent something like this.<br />Before wasting money on 4 of these I suggest you buy a single bag to see if you like them.<br />The 4 bags are well packed in a nice color printed carton.\n",

      "I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.\n",

      "I had hoped that these cookies would be a nice, new take on the classic Chips Ahoy. My family didn't like them and we threw out the package.<br /><br />The collective family opinion:<br /><br />- fake tasting - not like real chocolate<br />- soft, but not moist<br />- not gooey in the middle<br />- did not smell good, smelled fake<br /><br />Nabisco used unbleached flour which is better than enriched bleached flour, and I applaud Nabisco for making that move. They also added a generous amount of white chocolate chips, but these didn't help the end product. We will likely try new Chips Ahoy products but won't be buying these.\n",

      "Sweet (maybe a tad too sweet), with a pleasant citrusy flavor, this beverage would be great to serve at kid's parties or at a barbecue instead of regular soda - the ingredient list is certainly less scary and afterall a sparkling water-and-fruit juice drink is obviously better than one loaded with refined sugar (or even worse, artificial sweeteners), caffeine and chemical addtitives.<br /><br />While this isn't a healthy drink, it would be a great improvement for a regular soda drinker to switch to this instead - the improvement may not show in calories but it will show in general health: the lack of caffeine and lower sugar content will avoid calcium loss so common in regular soda drinkers, and your liver will appreciate the lack of highly processed chemical additives.<br /><br />I'm not a soda drinker but I will keep this in the fridge to offer to guests or serve to my next barbecue party.\n",

It works wonders with chicken & pork, keeping it moist and providing a slight crunch with just the right amount of flavor to keep things interesting, but not overpower the flavor of the meat. It's also a tasty addition to meatloaf, or as a topping for casseroles. Sure, it's a little more expensive than just buying bread crumbs, but in my opinion it's worth it. Good stuff!\n",

      "I used to drink Twinings India Spice Chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure. It was so much better than Tazo (all ginger and vanilla) and the other supermarket brands (all cinnamon). Before I found it on Amazon I could only get it at the CostPlus/World Market, but happily made the trip. It was often sold out but STILL worth trying for.<br /><br />Then Twinings decided to change their recipe. I think in an attempt to taste more like Tazo, they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom. It's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors.<br /><br />The positive thing I can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on Amazon Subscribe. And if you don't care about subtleties in flavor, the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time.  Not good, but less horrible.<br /><br />What was once a wonderful and satisfying tea experience now just gets the job done, but at the expense of all the joy :(\n",

      "I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as \"gluten intolerance\"in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.\n",

      "I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites.\n",

      "As a nurse practitioner, I've learned a lot about infant and child nutrition. First, you must understand that children under age 2 NEED fats for their brains to develop. Brain matter is mostly fat. If babies and toddlers don't get enough fat, their neurological development will be impaired. Human breast milk is mostly fat (about 50% of calories); while the other half is milk sugars (lactose). Protein is actually a very small part of human milk. Nature naturally has saturated fats & cholesterol in mother's milk for infant mammals, as well as the yolk of egg for baby chicks. In other words, fats, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol are very necessary and healthy for a rapidly growing infant body and brain. That is why FULL FAT dairy is recommended by all doctors for every child under the age of 2.<br />Anyways, in reviewing the nutritional data on this drink, it is very low in calories, especially fat calories. I'd be concerned if parents tried to replace dairy with this drink. A child's brain and development could negatively be affected by not having enough fat. Plus a child would not get enough calories with this drink.<br />Most other countries in the world use milk for their children- not necessarily cow's milk though. I've breastfed my daughter for 1 year, and have now switched her over to goat's milk, which is recommended for children who have milk intolerances or sensitivities. The fats and proteins in goats milk are more broken down, making it easier to digest than cow's milk. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to cow's milk, I'd recommend goat's milk much more over this \"rice drink\".\n",

      "Like the other reviewers we love the taste of this flour baked into bread. I had been trying (unsuccessfully) to convince family members to eat more whole wheat bread. I was trying new whole wheat recipes and perfecting the recipe and this flour just took the flavor over the top. So now I substitute half the whole wheat flour called for in my bread recipe with this Seven Grain flour. This Seven Grain flour provides a nutty flavor and a nice crunch to the bread which is lacking in whole wheat recipes.<br /><br />Originally I tried the Seven Grain bread recipe off the Great River site but was unsuccessful. Congrats to the reviewers who did find success. My bread loaf came out dense and suitable only for use as a hockey puck or doorstop. So while this is quality flour I do recommend that you continue to add vital wheat gluten to get a good rise on your loaf. I didn't my first attempt and that's probably why I was unsuccessful. Below is my family's favorite recipe-<br /><br />1 cup lukewarm milk<br />1/4 cup orange juice (you won't taste the OJ but it removes the bitterness of whole wheat flour)<br />1/4 cup vegetable oil (I use olive oil)<br />1/4 cup honey, molasses, or maple syrup (my family prefers honey)<br />1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour<br />1 1/2 cup Great River Seven Grain flour<br />1/2 cup bread flour<br />2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast<br />1 1/4 teaspoons salt<br />1 T Honeyville vital wheat gluten<br /><br />Throw ingredients into a bread machine in the correct order dictated by your manufacturer. I have a Zo bread machine so all liquids go in first on the bottom. Then add the flours and top with the instant yeast making sure no liquids touch the yeast. Set the bread machine on dough and allow it to do the work. When the machine is done (after the first rise) I divide the dough in half and place into two lightly greased glass medium 8x4 loaf pans and cover with a towel for the second rise. When doubled in size bake in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. Enjoy the flavor of this wonderful flour.\n",

Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.\n",

Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess.  I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since.  I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned.  They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants. Since I am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away I can't give it 5 stars but since I am pretty sure, I will give it four stars.

My students love it too. I like it because it's healthy and not overly sweet. What makes it my on-the-go snack of choice is it tastes great right out of the package -- the snack size packs are ideal for travel OR I just make my own with resealable sandwich bags. I've been enjoying this granola for over 20 years, and I'm glad it now comes in other flavors for variety. I've never tired of the taste of the original flavor, but I do love cinnamon and honey so the new ones seem like they've been made just for me. Thanks Mona! You're a gem! I also like how I can write to or call Mona and she is actually on the other end. She's a real human being and stands behind her wonderful products. -- How's THAT in this day and age of huge corporations that are out-of-touch with their customers? Not so at [...].

I often grill chicken with a chipotle-lime marinade using only this dressing and pureed adobo peppers to taste.  So easy, and best chicken we've ever had, both on its own or added to a chicken chili or tortilla soup.  On salads, this dressing is amazing with goat cheese, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, and whatever other vegetables you like.  So delicious I forget that it's a light dressing.

      "KIND bars are really the best of all the snack bars I've tried. They somehow manage to preserve the flavors and textures of the ingredients and still hold it together in a bar that's not overly sweet or salty. They do cost a little more than typical grocery store brands, so I watch for the occasional good sales and stock up. I find they have a pretty decent shelf life. With some of the other brands, I feel like there's often more filler and mystery ingredients than good stuff. With KIND, the fruit and nuts really take center stage. I haven't tried the ones with chocolate or yogurt.\n",

      "I have a 3 1/2 year old American Bulldog that has gone through thousands of dollars in vet bills and worthless speculations. She has been on Grandma Lucy's Rabbit Pureformance for several days now and I have already noticed the vast improvement in her demeanor and energy level. My dog used to violently scratch at herself till she made herself bleed. We discovered that she was allergic to beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and duck. Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself. It's made with all human grade ingredients which is good to know. My dog Sadie is 75lbs and a 10lb bag of this fantastic product lasts us approximately 20 days. It's a good deal and so easy to prepare...give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.\n",

      "Essentia 9.5 PH Drinking water is a bottled water made with good digestive health in mind. It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind. Combine that with the taste and improvements in digestion and you have a clear, bottled- water winner in my book.\n",

I also use Almond or hazel extracts instead of syrup for the same reason.  If you like a flavor boost in the coffee but don't like all the sweetness, a bit of extract is the way to go. And you control how much  flavor to add without any sugar.<br />When I was a kid, my mother would flavor milk with plain vanilla or almond to make it more palatable.  It's a good way to add a touch of flavor and sweet touch without sugar.<br />I use real vanilla extract for baking and custards, but I am sure Mccormick brand imitation vanilla is fine for baking too, just use a little more to taste.  That's the cook's choice.<br />When I make cocoa from real cocoa poweder, I use half the sugar and add this vanilla.  Voila, a hot drink with lots of chocolate flavor but not too sweet.<br />All together, a useful product for me and 32 oz was good value for the money.\n",

Yet, sometimes you need something to hold butter, meat, or cheese. These crackers work very well for that; they don't overpower the food and they are tasty.<br /> I did not think the crackers arrived stale. However, they do taste different than crispy, toasted crackers, if that is what you expected. I have bought Ryvita in many different supermarkets and small groceries and they always have this taste. They are thicker than what you might expect, and somewhat bland. They have taste because of the toppings that are baked into them. They are not salty, they are crispy-crunchy. They never are and I don't think they are supposed to be. They are not like saltines. They are not like Ritz crackers.<br />  They are very good, though. They have their own unique taste and texture.\n",

      "I recently had some blackberry jelly.  I don't remember ever having tasted blackberries before -- but I may have just forgotten.  Anyway, the jelly was VERY good.  So, I started hunting on Amazon for more blackberry flavoured products.<br /><br />MONIN FAVORED SYRUP, BLACKBERRY, 33.8-OUNCE PLASTIC BOTTLKES, (PACK OF 4) looked interesting.  There was just SOMETHING about te \"Monin\" brand that quietly stated, \"quality\".  Maybe it was the shape of the bottle, (looking a lot like a wine bottle), or maybe it was the<br />claim that no high-fructrose corn syrup, only natural sugar was used.<br />Four bottles seemed a bit much -- but I had now had tasted blackberry<br />flavouring, so I at least knew I'd probably like the taste....<br /><br />When the bottles arrived, it was more than a bit difficult for me to open the package.  I managed to make a break in the carton, big enough for one bottle to come out.  After I took out the first, the others came through the same opening.  This product is certainly is well-packed!<br /><br />When mixed with cold water, this syrup really is very, very tasty.  I'm sure there are nany receipes for this syrup -- but I just put in 1 part syrup to about 5 parts water, added some ice cubes....and I was in heaven!  Totally wonderful flavour.  If you like blackberries, you will absolutely LOVE this stuff!<br /><br />And the label does tell the tale.  ONLY Natural Sugar for sweetening!<br />No aspartame, no high-fructrose corn syrup, no splenda, no saccharine.<br />No kiding!<br /><br />Since it is non-alcholic -- it can be drunk by anyone not diabetic. Since the bottle is so pretty, and the contents taste SO good, it can also be given, as a present, pridefully!<br /><br />Now -- if only they would make my favourite flavor -- COLA!  I'e checked -- there is presently NO cola flavour of Monin syrup -- at least here on Amazon.  Drinking ola mae only with sugar is a dream of many people.  Mexican coke, (which is presently made that way), is very expensive.  And I'm sure that a \"Monin Cola\" flavour, would be tops in taste and quality! (And please, make a \"Malaga\" Wine flavor, in the future, as well!)<br /><br />More MONIN Please!\n",

I cut them up for stir frys and soups, and I slice them for sandwiches. They're good instead of chicken in a sandwich, but they are small and can fall out. How about a tortilla with avocado spread on it and some lettuce, wrapped around some Tender Bits, whole or sliced? Add pepper and/or onion! Although I am a strict vegetarian, I have a sensitive digestive system, and I turn to Tender Bits when my system is irritated. I have been eating these by the case for years and am glad to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Update: After being diagnosed with a small breast cancer, I learned that soy protein concentrate, a main ingredient in Tender Bits, is a controversial ingredient. To put it simply, foods with this ingredient are \"processed food\" and should be eaten in the amounts one would eat any processed meat or other food. Vegetarians should be careful about eating too much processed vegetarian foods. Soy has an important relationship to estrogen, which means that vegetarian women and especially those who have had estrogen-positive breast cancer should learn more about it.<br /><br />I have not had any Tender Bits in many months, but I keep a can on hand for special occasions!\n",

      "This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product \"Wheat Free\"? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising. Where there is no truth in advertising what trust can there be in any of the products the company produces?\n",

      "Shirataki style noodles are always sold wet. I suspect they shrivel up to nothing if you tried to dry them. The extra water gives them body. Do not try to use this in any recipe that calls for loose, cooked-but-fairly-dry rice: pilafs, fried rice, just a simple side of rice. You want to use these where they will work wet, and where you have a flavor to add to mask any lingering flavor from the packaging water. Soups would be ideal, or served with/under a stew. The linguine shape worked pretty well for a Cincinnati chili 3-way.<br /><br />In general, I recommend to anyone who has never tried shiratake noodles before to buy one package, not a case of 6. We bought a case, and ended up throwing most of them away because the smell from the packaging was so off-putting we couldn't bring ourselves to use the noodles. Yes, the smell rinses away, but can you get past that to use them?\n",

      "I like the taste of Oolong tea.  This is along the same lines as far as taste, but much darker and flavorful.  I personally can drink it without sweetening it, but I still do add some sweetner.<br /><br />I have seen ways to prepare it on youtube, but I guess I do my own thing.<br /><br />I have a small 12 oz cup with a strainer.  I break up a relatively small portion and run hot water through it.  I immediately dump it out.  Some of the fine particles wash out and the tea is very light.  I let it sit damp for a while (most of the time overnight).  It seems that since the tea is now soaked, I can pour hot water over the tea leaves/stems and immediately remove the strainer (and consume).  I can do this 2 more times that same way as the same batch.  On the fourth time, I let it steep a few minutes to get the last bit out and then discard the used up tea leaves.<br /><br />I have heard that there are some health benefits from drinking this tea.  I cannot comment one way or another as I have not noticed anything.  I like the taste and the pick me up.  I usually have 2 cups a day between breakfast and lunch.  I like my sleep, so I personally wouldn't drink it too late in the day.  I also don't get too jittery like drinking a Venti Tarbucks.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

      ":) Well my honey recommended this for help in healing a freshly stitched up chainsaw induced wound. Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)\n",

      "I've done the several batches of this mix. Before anyone claims they hate it, try these simple tricks.<br /><br />1. Add 1 tsp of baking powder -> adds fluff (1 tsp for every cup of flour)<br /><br />2. If allergic to eggs -> use Ener-G egg replacement. Follow the directions. Add 1 tsp of olive oil (help with the texture since the egg fat isn't present)<br /><br />3. DO NOT OVER MIX! GO slow if you have to. Watch a video on knowing when the dough is elastic so you know when to stop. (One of the flours in this batch gets hard from over mixing - will update when I remember which one)<br /><br />4. Keep the 3 tbsp of oil (I used olive oil) Chebe calls for. If you replace with applesauce, it will add as a binder. Trust me, you do NOT want two binders in a recipe.<br /><br />5. Take your time rolling the dough to make it nice and tight. This keeps the Cinnamon mix in the middle.<br /><br />6. To heat up the rolls again, DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE! Use a toaster oven or a nonstick pan with a cover. I personally use the pan and steam heat the rolls again.<br /><br />These tricks may not work for all. I will update when I learn more and feel free to post your own tricks.\n",

      "I'm quite the novice when it comes to rice, so I'm not going to deliver any lectures on the genetic and cultural history of sticky white rice. I just know that I like the sticky rice that I've gotten from the better Chinese take-out restaurants. I also know that the precooked rice packages I was preparing at home were too expensive and not that good. And it also seemed like a good time to stop eating too many potatoes.<br /><br />So I bought a bag of this rice, a bestselling Aroma rice cooker, and a good rice washing bowl. My selections weren't based on expertise. I just went with things at the top of Amazon's bestseller lists that were in an economical price range. I carefully rinsed enough rice for a dinner party of four, threw it all in the cooker, pushed two buttons, and checked it an hour later.<br /><br />Boy, was I ever amazed. This product produced the best sticky white rice I've had from anywhere--home cooking, take-out, restaurants. It has that nice glutinous quality that allows the rice clump to together in some of the most favorable mouthfuls I have ever had so far as white rice. This stuff is really a keeper. At the rate I'm going through  it, one bag might last 5-6 weeks. And that's for just one person.<br /><br />I guess this rice is good for sushi. I wouldn't know. I just like to load it on a plate, use some salt, crushed peppercorns, and soy sauce, and put something else (like an entree) off to the side. The rice is so good by itself, the entree is almost incidental.<br /><br />So I expect to be buying more very soon and highly recommend this. I also recommend the Aroma cookers, which are quite the bargain right now.\n",

      "My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.\n",

      "To help me with my Weight Watchers diet, I have been searching for a healthy peanut butter.  I found PB2 on Amazon and gave the regular flavor a try.  It is perfect for my needs.  When I saw the chocolate I had to give it a try.  It is wonderful!! I mix the powder to a peanut butter consistancy and spread over toast.  I mix the power in milk for a wonderful milk shake.  And it fits perfectly within my Weight Watchers diet, giving me lots of flavor for a minimum of points (you WW's know what I'm talking about.)  My daughter loves it, as do most of the people who have tasted it.<br /><br />Because it is a powder, it does not contain fat.  People expecting a rich peanut butter/chocolate taste may be disappointed.  However, after a few tries I find I like this much better than traditional peanut butter.  I like it so much I have ordered it 3 times, and will continue to order this delicious treat.\n",

      "I just received my order from 1 Quick cup of this coffee today and was never so anxious to try a Kcup due to all the raving reviews. I brewed it in my B40 @ the 9.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. This is a wonderfully blend; not harsh not weak and it doesn't try to be something it is not. I know that sounded a bit odd but that was my first impression. This is my third cup this afternoon so I would like to try another cup without the nuances of the other kcups on my palate<br /><br />Not to be redundant from what the other reviewers have written; it's very mellow yet rich and doesn't bite back and leaves no harsh after taste. Can't wait to try it later @ the 7.25 mug size.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well I just had my Caribou @ the 7.25 mug size and it was as delicious as the larger mug size. A bit more after taste but again not offensive. Though I read that this coffee is a medium roast, to me, it tastes more like a light roast which I seem to gravitate to. I will brew it @ the larger mug size just so I can enjoy it longer. Caribou differently hit the nail on the head with this one. So it wins a spot on my top ten favorite Kcups list.\n",

      "Relative luxury items that charge a premium are subject to a greater degree of discrimination on the basis of commanding margin substanailly higher than that of more mid-stream, value or bang for the buck items.  If you're going to spend $30 for a 16 oz bag of Coffee, the expectation is that the quality of the product is high to exceptional.  My personal opinion, and that of several office co-horts, was that the quality of this product did not match the price point.<br /><br />Our office purchased a Techni-Vorum Moccamaster, with a copper heating element,  for ideal brewing.  Bottled Culligan water was used to make the coffee.  Under such conditions, the sweet flavor of Kona shines.  This did not happen with this product.  The consensus in the office is that the beans were stale.<br /><br />One trick in the food industry to add margin is to sell products that are slightly aged, and a at least a little bit if not moderately on the way to expiration.  This is the model that Trader Joe's operates under.  The difference is with Trader Joes, you pay less for the product, so there is still some relative value in the purchase.<br /><br />Pure Speculation:  I do wonder if this is the case with this product.  Higher Margin Product not selling in recession, gets older, passed off at disproportionately high price point.  I can not know.  What I do know is that I will not be buying this again. Again, while my experiences with Kona with other lines have been outstanding, this particular product was stale.  Suggestions on other Kona lines appreciated.  I am willing to pay up for good beans.  If paying at this price point, the expectations are high.<br /><br />Did have better Luck with Caffe Britt, which while a darker roast, exceptional quality, and good value at the price point on Amazon.  Happy brewing.\n",

I've never seen much of a difference using sports drinks vs cold water, but many people do. This drink would be a much cheaper alternative to those $1 and $2 sports drinks. It does have a different \"texture\" than regular water, perhaps because of the Ph level.<br /><br />There is no source specified, so I assume it's from tap water.  The source does not really matter to me. Many of the springs in this country are becoming contaminated, and those that draw water from \"mountain streams\" - eeewww!  Animals and people use those as a bathroom, and things die and rot there.  The bottom line is that ALL water get filtered thoroughly, no matter the source, and it all starts in the same place.

No enriched flour in these at all--graham flour and whole grain oats.  With the exception of monocalcium phosphate (part of the leavening), all ingredients are recognizable and easy to pronounce.

To start with, the image of the cookie on the package looked nothing like the contents within.  Perhaps it was because the cookies arrived on my doorstep in the heat of summertime, I don't know, but what I found were trays of unappealing, blackened-looking (because of the fudge interior) chocolate chip cookies.  Oddly, it looked as if these snacks got into a fight and emerged all black and bruised.<br /><br />Still, a cookie might look ugly and still offer up a great taste.  Well, not so much.  Yes, there was a definite overload of chocolate, to be sure, but it had a sandy, gritty taste.  I stopped my snacking after a single cookie, even though the serving size is two for 3.5 grams of saturated fat (thankfully, no trans fat).  Again, I am willing to accept that I maybe got a bad package or one effected by the heat, though I rescued it from my porch less than ten minutes after it was dropped off by UPS.  I can't recommend this, unfortunately.  I would instead go with a Keebler Soft Batch cookie any day.\n",

      "I don't like artificial sweeteners because they're too sweet, so while sipping Switch's Kiwi Berry drink, I kept rechecking the can for a sign of any sort of diet ingredient. None were listed.  Switch says there's nothing but sparkling juice in the can, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so that's that.<br /><br />I like the amount of sparkle in the juice, but as a thirst quencher, it was too cloyingly sweet, at least for me. This certainly doesn't mean you might not love it -- I just prefer my sweet with a good dose of tart.<br /><br />Verdict: I'll stick to a good old-fashioned kiwi-strawberry beverage from Snapple or Trader Joe's or Costco. They all have good ones.<br /><br />By the way, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54\">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was also sweet, but far more to my liking.\n",

I've tried a few different types of matcha powder and unfortunately resorted to this as a substitute for my daily tea until my next shipment came in from Japan. It's downright awful. That picture on the bag is what a higher quality tea looks like, the actual product turns out to be a muddy looking green. After my bad experience trying to use it in hot tea, I tried putting this in smoothies, baking with it, using it in icecream, nothing would take away the bitterness. I kept adding less and less matcha powder to my recipes, but the bitter taste was there if there was any hint of green tea flavor.<br /><br />Just save your money and buy some real matcha powder. Don't convince yourself that you're enjoying it just because you so desperately want to enjoy matcha green tea. It isn't your fault if you've tried this and don't like it. If someone gave this to me for free, I would politely refuse it. No way I'd re-gift something so terrible unless I hated the person!\n",

      "i will start off by sayin the dr. mcdougall brand is a life saver for me. being a vegan it can be difficult to find really quick and easy meals. i was scared to buy all of them at once, so at my local store i got one of every flavor. they are all tastey but to me this one stood out. the flavor is awesome. i cook it differently than the package says ( i do that for all of them).<br /><br />the only problem i have with the asian entrees is that it is 200 calories per serving and there is two in a cup. noone is only going to eat half of it. that would just be a bad idea. other flavors have less calories per serving. and at my local store you can get it for the about the same price per container. i know that might be location dependant because when i lived in a different state it was cheaper to get it here. i know with the subscribe and save it always works out to get it on amazon. i keep these in my car because i never know if i need a meal on the go. these are super handy and super tastey. i would recommend any of them.\n",

      "I have two dogs of the same mixed breed, but they are complete opposites. One dog barely chews on anything (even chew toys/bones/rawhide) and the other one is a chewing monster. The one that I dub \"chew monster\" has been able to chew everything I've thrown at him even since he was a puppy. I've gone through numerous personal items because of his destructive habit and under recommendation by my vet, she mentioned trying some Nylabones.<br /><br />I started out with the puppy Nylabones and then upgraded him to the regular ones, but he went through those too fast (within hours down to spiny nubs). Despite being a 9.6 pound dog, I eventually had to upgrade him to the \"Dura Chew\" model which is aimed at powerful chewers. Nylabone states that these are the strongest ones they make. With the Dura Chew, I'm able to slow down the speed in which he goes through these to a week or so.<br /><br />Although my dog will still occasionally chew through my personal items I leave on the floor, I can say the Nylabones \"Dura Chew\" has helped curb his urge to chew on other things and he mostly chews on the Nylabones. They are a lifesaver!<br /><br />Locally (at PetSmart, PetCo, and Pet Supermarket), Nylabones are usually $2.50 each + tax. For some odd reason on Amazon, these are $1.78 each. So by buying on Amazon, I'm saving at least 75 cents each per bone that I know my dog loves.<br /><br />So it's a no brainer that if your dog likes Nylabones and needs the Dura Chew model, you should look compare prices at Amazon first.\n",

      "To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor.\n",

      "So, I'm usually a Keebler guy, and even then it's the Cinnamon Grahams.  That said, I don't eat a lot of any sort of graham on a regular basis regardless ... my household would (most days) test graham-negative across the board (for you microbiologists out there ;), so this is sort of a minor detour from the norm for me.  Still, nothing wrong with a little Honey Maid from time to time.<br /><br />Anyway, the packaging is about right for two people to share a packet (2 -not 4- individual, regular rectangular crackers each, stacked 8 high).  This is a departure from the old 4 per sheet packaging, and it's a huge deal, and here's why.  To finish off one of the old (standard/larger) packets of graham crackers (4X the amount per packet, roughly), you have to be both voracious and consistent in your crumbly graham consumption.  If not, your crackers are likely to go stale before the open packet is gone, necessitating waste and the opening of another big packet.  These \"Fresh Stacks\" packets are a day or two's worth of breakfast snack, then you open a new/fresh pack w/o wasting the old one.  Yes, it's more packaging and smaller, but seriously, haven't you ever had the size/spoilage issue?  Savings via bulk aren't savings until you consume everything you bought.  Barring that, you need a new calculation factoring in only price per quantity used...just sayin.<br /><br />More importantly, who's ever made S'mores and had to 1) hold a piece of chocolate 2) hold a fire-stick with a flaming marshmallow on the end while 3) trying to break a graham-cracker slab into roughly equal halves ... all the while holding off inquisitive, insistent and \"helpful\" little fingers and a frenzied dog (who also seems to think chocolate is the cure for cancer, adding to the furor) amid a chorus of verbal coaching on how to \"do it right\" ... ?  Am I the only one?  So, I hate it when the slab breaks unevenly, thus these Honey Maid Fresh Stacks eliminate the challenging operation of bisecting a graham cracker slab while both of my hands are partially otherwise engaged.  Not that it's a giant, groundbreaking innovation, but I usually judge inventions and updates to products based on how many times I've said, \"Dang!\" in reference to the situation said innovation addresses.  I've said \"Dang!\" to stale, half-gone packs of grahams, and I've said, \"Dang!\" to botched S'mores, so these cut the mustard in my book.  Like with the spaghetti pot on TV that has holes in the lid for easily draining your noodles, I found myself wondering why nobody came up with this sooner...\n",

      "I love coffee, and a particular fantasy of mine would be to go to all these exotic places, make friends with the natives, tour their coffee plantations, sample their wares, and pack my bags with a supply of their goods.  (Of course, I would pay them dearly for their goods and services.)<br /><br />Since I can't go to any of these places, I have to settle for imported coffee.  This box of coffee is \"Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe\", \"ethically farmed-artisan roasted\", and is also fair trade certified and USDA approved.<br /><br />This particular coffee that I am reviewing is \"exotic floral and berry\".  This particular box has 15 individual, individually-wrapped (that's the part I like!) servings.<br /><br />I made this coffee this morning, and I love it.  It isn't very strong, so it might not be for everyone.  (Sometimes coffee is just too strong.)  I plan on making more of this coffee later today.<br /><br />I currently don't have an Espresso machine in my kitchen, but I hope to one day have one.  Whenever that time comes, I look forward to the day that I can make cappuccinos and other exotic coffee drinks with all these exotic coffees.<br /><br />UDDATE Sunday, April 15, 2012:  I did make more coffee last night (the coffee was so good - who could resist?); however, that was a big mistake.  I did not go to bed until early this morning; consequently, I slept late, missed church, and the day was ruined.  (I will go to church tonight.)  The caffiene must have been strong.  From now on, I will only drink this coffee in the morning.  I sure wish I had of had this coffee back when I was in the Army and had to pull all-night duty.\n",

Glad these chips are available here in the U.S. and uses great flavoring with Heinz brand ketchup. Many think it may seem odd to have ketchup on chips, its similar to eating normally fries and ketchup. It doesn't have that strong of a overwhelming ketchup flavor on the chips, which is great, reason many of my friends like them<br /><br />If really want a stronger ketchup flavored taste, I personally recommend get a bottle of Heinz ketchup and dip your ketchup flavored chips into some actual ketchup, like you would with fries.\n",

I had also ramped up to running 2-3 miles three times a week (from 1.5 to 2/ 2 times a week). When my cycle came and went with heavily reduced symptoms, I was in disbelief!! Next month, I switched to the PMS tea after day 20. The month after I had the PMS tea for the whole month. There is no looking back for me.<br /><br />Here are all the areas where I saw a SIGNIFICANT difference: Oily skin/hair, energy levels, I-AM-GOING-TO-CHEW-MY-NAILS-OFF cramps, bloating, body aches and the MOOD!<br /><br />Relevant asides:<br /><br />The PMS tea: doubled amount of Dandelion root (500mg compared to the Detox).  Caffeine free with 89% certified organic ingredients. Taste - meh...but tolerable<br /><br />The Detox tea: 250 mg of Dandelion extract. Apparently they revamped this product owing to concerns of sustainable access to ingredients. That is pretty commendable I think! Plus whatever they did, rocks! Taste gets a 10/10. Has a small amount of Kukicha caffeine. And again, the formula is 85% organic.<br /><br />Both products contraindicated for pregnant (detox only of course) or breastfeeding sisters.<br /><br />If you do review the product, please add tags, to help resolve some of the confusion here :)<br /><br />Last but not least the six pack price is a steal.

      "The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!\n",

      "I love most Bob's Red Mill products and have been buying from them for 10+ years.  However, this is my least favorite of their products.  This stuff is easy to cook with, it's true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it's cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices.  I have no idea why I used to cook with this stuff so often other than that I didn't know much about cooking in HS and it looked \"high protein\" on the label.  I recently read The Whole Soy Story by Kaayla Daniel (Amazon has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like TSP are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause.  Although TSP appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don't absorb much of the protein, anyway.  While I am glad Bob's is using organic soybeans to make their TSP (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it's \"organic\" doesn't make it a healthy or even a safe product.  The dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant's natural way of deterring pests.  Traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact.  TSP is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients.  As a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, I'll continue to buy other Bob's products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but I am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like TSP.\n",

      "I've always preferred the boxed Velveeta with shells over Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (or is it cheese and macaroni?).  It's cheesier and more flavorful.  To now compete with Hamburger Helper, Velveeta came out with their new \"Cheesy Skillets\" meal-in-a-box.  I tried the \"Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac\" version.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any hamburger on hand, so I used what I did have: kielbasa.  I also added some roasted peppers.<br /><br />The pasta in Velveeta Cheesy Skillets is a much larger version of elbow macaroni.  It really holds and absorbs the sauce well.  In addition to the tradition soft cheese sauce like the Velveeta shells boxes come with, there's a seasoning packet to add to the meat, pasta, and water.  It really added a lot of flavor to the already rich, creamy cheese sauce.  It feels a step above Hamburger Helper, much like their boxed shells is a step above traditional boxed macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />My only disappointment?  There was literally only a handful of pasta included in the big box.  And the package says that it contains five servings.  Five?  Seriously?  Who are they kidding?  If I split the box up into five servings, everyone would literally get half a cupful.  These are supposed to be entire meals-in-one, not side dishes.  Let's be realistic here.<br /><br />My suggestion?  Buy the box and an additional box of pasta, add additional water when cooking, and you'll make a real dinner for five.  There's plenty of seasoning and sauce to cover and flavor any added pasta.\n",

However, hairspray queen that I am, anything that says it will give a boost to my super-fine, limp hair finds its way home with me.<br /><br />From my initial encounter with Clear, I saw a difference.  My hair looked fuller.  Other costly products make my hair look fuller, but with a drier look.  This shampoo gave me sheen like a conditioner without the limp feel of a conditioning shampoo.  Additionally, my hair was so much easier to style than after shampooing with those costlier volumizing shampoos - a half a bottle of hairspray on my hair as opposed to a full bottle!  LOL!<br /><br />Seriously, I've been using Clear for over a week, and I can't get over the difference in my hair.  Oh, yes, the fragrance is nice and the appearance of the shampoo itself,  but to me--I don't care if it smells like manure pouring out of the bottle, I just want -not good--but great hair ... so I can give that lioness within full reign upon the day ahead ... this brand of Clear is something to roar about.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE\n",

      "I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.

      "I have spent a ridiculous amout of money trying to get my 2 new dogs to eat.  I tried the major brands and the expensive brands, researched the internet for recommendations, wet/dry you name it.  I was always faced with the few sniffs and then the look up at me in bitter disappointment. I never was a dog person but these two were dumped by me so I took them in (the vet said they looked like at one time they had been pound dogs because of spaying tatoos). I felt sorry for them and would give them table scraps...big mistake.  I also used treats for housebreaking. They had a feeder which contained what was described in research of consumer reports as a \"guarantee your dog would love\" that they would walk over to and sniff and walk away. I put the Bingo-Mega in there and now they are excited when I give them their dish. My neighbors are going to be very disappointed that their dogs will no longer be receiving the bags, cans and treats my dogs refused.\n",

This item isn't it. It was perhaps the most middle of the road, marginal cup I've had in a long time. Little taste, marginally robust, and lots of caffeine. I won't ever buy it again.

I loved the unique combo of foods (pear, spinach, broccoli), the pouch packaging (great for squeezing out onto a spoon for on-the-go feeding, or just to save the trouble of washing a bowl!), and the fact that my baby devoured it. She absolutely loved it! I tried it as well, and it does taste good. It does have a predominant pear taste. Really the only negative thing about this (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) is the astronomical price tag. I'm not sure the \"organic\" label warrants it being about four times as pricey as its jarred counterparts.\n",

      "Either Celestial Seasonings simply forgot to update amazon.com, or else it's a deliberate omission on the part of Celestial Seasonings, but you should be aware that soy lecithin is an unlisted ingredient in this blueberry tea. It's also in all the \"Zinger\" teas I've checked in local stores and in other Celestial Seasonings teas as well. But it's not listed here on amazon.com in the \"ingredients\" section. I phoned the company last spring when I first noticed this \"adulteration\" because I couldn't imagine why anyone would add soy lecithin to tea! I've nothing against soy lecithin. Sometimes I add it to yoghurt, but that's my own choice. Also, the source should be organic (or from a reliable supplier like Lewis Labs), since non-organic soy is almost always genetically modified.<br /><br />Anyway, I phoned the company's customer relations department and asked what was going on with the soy lecithin. The woman had no idea what I was talking about so I explained, step by step, what I had found on a Zinger tea box I had nearly purchased that day. She said she had heard nothing about it but she checked her computer for company updates. After scrolling through many items, she came to a small notice in, as I recall, their in-house March 2008 entry (a year prior to my call), which stated that soy lecithin would now be added to selected teas; no reason was given. That struck me as very odd -- that even their own employees had not been properly notified. The woman apologized for the mix-up. That wasn't very satisfactory from my point of view but I let it go. That's all the info she had and it certainly wasn't her fault that her company obviously wanted to fly under the radar on this one.<br /><br />Since then, any time I'm attracted to a new Celestial Seasonings product, I first read the ingredients. They used to be a company I trusted -- not anymore -- although I still love their (as-yet) soy-free Bengal Spice; India Spice Chai; Nutcracker Sweet Holiday Tea; Sleepytime; Echinacea Complete Care; Vanilla/Strawberry/Rose Ceylon Black Tea; Moroccan Pomegranate; and Red Safari Spice.  But I now carefully check those labels too whenever I buy a new batch lest Celestial Seasonings have pulled a fast-one and added soy lecithin to them as well!<br /><br />Why haven't customers raised more of a hullabaloo over this? Probably because this company has indeed had our trust for many years (never mind that they've been sold to less trustworthy firms along the way!) and no one bothers to read their labels! Maybe now they will.<br /><br />(P.S. I'm a blueberry fiend and would probably make this my all-time favorite tea! -- but not with soy lecithin in it!!)\n",

      "I love India Tree and wish this was organic and non-GMO. However for occasional use I will overlook that. India Tree fondant sugar is 100 times finer than regular powdered sugar and that does make a difference in icings and other decorations. I used it for royal icing on sugar cookies.  One caveat: I was really annoyed that their recipe calls for 1 lb. or 1.25(!!) packages of the stuff meaning you have to buy 2 packages worth. Why on earth don't they provide a recipe for a single package of fondant sugar rather than 1.25??? I don't usually need a calculator when I follow a recipe so that was really annoying. And don't bother substituting regular powdered sugar to make up the difference ~ your icing tip will clog, clog, clog.\n",

Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy.\n",

      "Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!\n",

Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.

      "Given that it was a Scotsman -- a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale -- who first marketed his particular blend under the name \"breakfast tea\" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word \"English\" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of \"acquired taste\" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the \"water of life\" (\"uisgue beatha\") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.<br /><br />Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday \"work horse\" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!\n",

I decided to take a long road trip (4500 miles round trip), and I have a tendency to get drowsy if I don't get enough protein.  I decided to carry these plus some string cheese in the car to tide me over between meal stops.<br /><br />I really like these.  The flavor is good, the texture is fine, and the \"damage\" from a diet standpoint is minimal (these are 60 cal apiece, based on the Jack Links site).  They're not too salty, either.  Having them on the trip from Bellingham, WA to St. Louis, MO and back was a huge help.  One or two of these provided just the right amount of tasty protein.  The size and packaging is handy, too, and easy to open when driving.<br /><br />I now keep them on hand for when I need a little pick-me-up.\n",

He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult.

I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.\n",

So if you have a half hour for your lunch hour, this is a great choice. The packaging is really ingenious.<br /><br />We recently had a Barilla sauce from a jar at home that I thought was a bit bland; but this was good. Tomato and a touch of red-pepper heat.<br /><br />Also in its favor is the fact that it is all natural. The fewer ingredients, the better & there aren't a lot here. 320 calories & 29% of the sodium you need in a day (so it's not perfect...but I'd really rather have the all natural than a chemical cocktail that has fewer calories).<br /><br />It IS a little expensive. Nearly 6$ per if you purchase here...strangely the Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce is less than 4$...so save money with that one! It's probably just as good!\n",

      "I switched my dog to the Iams Healthy Naturals chicken food about 2 months ago. Previously, she was eating Science Diet for the past 2 years. I didn't have any big issues with Science Diet, except for the fact that it was fairly expensive and I could only buy it at one of the local pet stores. Due to work schedules, it is sometimes difficult to get to a pet store while they were still open.<br />The reason I picked this Iams product is because the first few ingredients are actually meat, not wheat or rice, etc. I switched my dog over to the brand slowly, and she seems very happy with it. I realize there ARE better quality dog foods out there, such as the Blue Buffalo brands. However, the dog really didn't care for it, and the cat that did try to eat it had an allergic reaction, so we stopped buying it. That is more expensive - if our dog liked it more and we could keep the cat from getting into it we would have dealt with the cost, but it just doesn't work for us.<br />Our two cats LOVE the Iams dog food as well. We feed them Iams Proactive chicken flavor cat food, but when I fill the dog dish, they will run to it and try to eat as much as they can before the dog gets to it. I think it is a good product for a decent price.\n",

It might sound silly to buy 2 jars of coconut oil just to use it as moisturizer, but I thought I can try it in food as well. I like the smell, as opposite to other people, though it's not strong to hurt your nose, and it disappears in few minute. Cooking in coconut oil, is like cooking in water, it does not have the same texture as olive oil, it looks watery, and it gives a nice taste to the food. Having it on your skin, it dry in couple minute leaving your skin smooth and not oily at all.I never tried coconut oil before, so I cannot compare it to other brand.\n",

That being said, I rarely drink flavored coffees but do like them once in a while as a change of pace.

      "With 5 dogs of various breeds, ages, and sizes, it's difficult to find a quality food that meets everydoggy's tastes. With NRG Maxim Buffalo, we have found it! Plates of this food are quickly licked clean!<br /><br />We've tried other dehydrated/raws. HK smells very herby, and no one seemed to like it. Lucy's is apparently tasty, but its appearance will tell you it's mostly dried mashed potato. The ingredients in NRG are recognizably buffalo and veggies. There's a pleasant, fresh aroma upon adding water.<br /><br />For maximum convenience, I immediately portion out the box of food into smaller plastic containers. I suppose they could stay out, but I stack most of the containers in my freezer. I add COLD water to a container and put it in the fridge overnight. Next morning, it's reconstituted and ready to serve after warming up.<br /><br />Pricy? Maybe. But keep in mind that 10 pounds of dehydrated turns into much more after adding water. And the quality of this food is worth the price. I strongly believe that eating should be one of the pleasures of a dog's life. What made us think that it's okay to relegate a dog to a lifetime of eating only dry kibble?

      "I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.\n",

Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.

      "Zapps potato chips are absolutely delicious.  Every flavor is marvelous; we buy them at the grocery store and order the multi-flavor packs online.  Voodoo is our family favorite; it has a perfect amount of Cajun zing but is not hot, just very flavorful.  A bag has never lasted more than one meal at our house - it is constantly being passed and devoured.  The lucky winner is the one who steals the seasoning from the bag liner at the bottom of the feast!  After finding Zapps, we eat no other type of potato chip.  Certainly everyone has his own opinion but for us, Zapps Voodoo is as good as it can get.  Bon Appetit and Laissez Les Bontemps Rouler!\n",

      "I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!\n",

The picture doesn't do the bag Justice as it has a zip-lock feature. It will take some time to drink all of this one bag and I purchased 4 different varieties.

      "Okay so for those of you hesitating thinking this is going to taste too much like something a staunch old man sitting in a ritzy Victorian library would drink, its not. Its also not like the stuff the teens would swill behind the bleachers in high school during winter football games. Wait, maybe that was just at my school. Anyway this stuff is GOOOOOD!<br /><br />Someone else said in their review it reminded them of Juicy Fruit gum and they totally hit the nail on the head with that assessment! Had this not been named \"Brandy\" I would have thought it was a fruit blend - not a punch like Hawaiian Punch, not even a tropical mixture, but just a really yummy sweet fruit blend of some kind. I really wish I could pick out specific fruit flavor elements to relate to you but I can't. Fruit Medley is all I can think of but there is a whipped cream like aspect to it, something that really makes you feel like you bit into some ripe juicy fruit (no pun intended) and it really does taste like that gum! This is one your kids would LOVE! Seriously if you want to get your kids or anyone in the family into matcha I would suggest this or the butterscotch matcha! Just make a latte with some milk, and some vanilla or sweet cream non dairy creamer! Add ice, stir LOVE!<br /><br />Now as for the Brandy aspect here. Its really not all that present to me. Yes I do get a SLIGHT and I mean SLIGHT alcohol effect - sort of a little twang or ting, but not really so much warming as brandy is known for.<br /><br />When I was younger, in my teens, I rode both western and equestrian, and trained horses. That was another life time ago. We would always have some brandy on us to keep warm in the winter wether out on the ranch repairing fences or preparing for a fox hunt (we did not really hunt the foxes I would have no part in that so don't worry) it was more of a Mock Hunt. LOL This matcha does bring back some fond memories of that but its not the same, and I doubt that you really could get the same result from anything but brandy itself but for all intents and purposes this is a very good flavor, a really nice experience, and one I will absolutely be ordering again! I know I say that about a lot of the matcha I have tried, and I have tried a lot of them but this along with about 5 others are THE matcha I can't be without! The \"alcohol\" effect is just enough for those who have had brandy to recognize but not so much that those who do not like brandy, have never had it, or should not have it, won't even notice. Its like being able to recognize any flavor, you kind of have to have experienced it before to know what it is. Without knowing what it is all you will notice is this AMAZING fruit festival in your mouth!\n",

      "I've always used short-grained glutinous rice in my meals, but I needed something a little lower on the glycemic index. After much research, I discovered Basmati rice rated as low, if not lower, than brown rice (which I cannot stomach). Next came the question of which Basmati brand to purchase from. Since this was for health reasons, it was very important that I find a brand I could trust, and Tilda ranked high on everyone's list due to their reputation and genetic testing of their grains.<br /><br />The rice arrived in a very convenient bag with an easy resealable slide along the top (in the photo where the gold band is). My rice was very fragrant but not as strong as Jasmine rice...a plus in my book. The rice was free of detritus and cooked up nice and fluffy in my Zojirushi rice cooker. The flavor was nice and subtle; a plus when pairing with delicate flavors as you don't want your rice to overpower the other food in terms of aroma, taste, and texture. I definitely plan on purchasing again.\n",

      "I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong \"green\" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened. I relegated it to cooking and foods that it would be mixed in with, like hummus. Over time, I have grown to like it more, and now occasionally even use it for drizzling on salads and other foods where the olive oil's flavor is a stand-out part of the dish.<br /><br />I usually drizzle a little EVOO on top of hummus when I serve it along with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tzatziki and tabbouleh. Mmm, one of my favorite meals! I use the Zoe when I make the hummus, then use my favorite <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFG56A\">'Nunez del Prado' Flor de Aceite Olive Oil Glass by La Tienda</a>, for the drizzle. I have bought it in a 1 Liter tin at my local upscale grocery store, but it is more expensive than the Zoe. I discovered Nunez de Prado when I asked them to let me have an olive oil tasting (like a wine tasting), and this one was by far my personal favorite.<br /><br />The special addition you get by drizzling the oil over many different foods really adds a lot of dimension and flavor, so you really want to get one that you love.<br /><br />The spout is messy no matter how I hold the can, so I decant it in into a glass bottle (store it in a dark cabinet).<br /><br />Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this oil for the price, it is very good quality, though it's not my favorite.\n",

The old version had a hint of lemon and the new version is completely tasteless and leaves a horrible after-taste in your mouth.  Nice going Austin.  Won't purchase again.  Austin needs to take a lesson from previous companies that tried to change what was already good and go back to the original.\n",

Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the \"bulge\" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.\n",

The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles. I would not buy again and I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />One note, I purchased this product through Amazon but Sold by: J&M Goods, LLC<br />Not sure if that makes any difference now you can buy direct.\n",

The Kitchens of India flavours and spices are much more tantalizing in equivalent entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />The only problem I previously had with Kitchens of India is we'd order one variety at a time and before the family finished them we'd be ready to move onto another.

I was quite pleased with what I received mainly because I wasn't sure what to expect.  I still had a little bit of the olive oil from my old bottle left so I was able to taste the two and the Zoe Diva one was far superior in my opinion.  To think I paid about 9 dollars for a smaller sized bottle of the other stuff made me laugh as Amazon did it again helping me save some more money on an item I need quite often.<br /><br />The packaging it arrived in was pretty good and the outside plastic that held the two bottles together looked to have a lot of traces of oil on it and it did, but neither of my bottles were leaking at all.  I guess maybe it was just residual oil from when it was being packaged or maybe another set leaked.<br /><br />Still its in my S&S to be shipped every 6 months and looks like it will stay that way.\n",

I tried so hard with whole wheat...even managing to choke down a half and half mixture, but it played havoc with my digestive system, and the taste and texture were so bad that I would actually become nauseous after eating it.<br /><br />Then I stumbled across a review of whole wheat pastas. I had no idea they could be different, but bionaturae received rave reviews, so I placed an order. Am I glad I did. Fantastic pasta that has almost the same texture as \"white\" pasta and none of that heavy gumminess that makes other whole wheat brands so hard to choke down. Fusilli is my to-go shape as it holds onto sauces so well. I love pairing it with some seafood alfredo or a hearty marinara. I even like it just plain with some butter and parmigian cheese. After having consistent, positive results with both this and the spaghetti, I can safely recommend any of the shapes by this brand.\n",

      "Which is exactly what I was after.  I'm trying to gain weight and these are a fantastic quick source of calories for a busy guy trying hit his daily caloric intake.  They are somewhat high in fat, but they are mostly the \"good\" fats (poly/mono-unsaturated).  Great source of protein and SHOCKINGLY low in sodium.  Now if you're really active then more sodium isn't a bad thing, but if you snack on other stuff like beef jerky, crackers (or anything canned) you're already going to have a surplus of sodium (40mg a serving, which is 100mg a pack, that's \"5%\" total in the bag, based on 2,000 calories a day, obviously).  This is a great way to try and balance that out.  Just realize that this isn't the low calorie snack you want if you're trying to shed a few inches around the waist, but if you don't mind the calories, or you need them, these are worth it!  I suppose I should also mention that the taste is fantastic?  Fresh tasting.<br /><br />As a last little tip, I know we all love the M&M's, but if you remove those, it will lower the calories to about 115 a serving (instead of 160), remove just about all of the sugar, as well as most of the saturated fat.\n",

      "From Michael's other half - I have made a lot of gluten free breads. Gluten-free bread baking is an art, not a science. Weather, moods, oven differences, and mischievous fairies can all wreak havoc, even with the best recipe. That being said, I figured that I would need a few tries to get this mix to an edible form. But I did NOT!! First try, using my breadman bread maker for a 2.0lb White loaf with medium crust did the trick perfectly. I used milk instead of water as optioned on the recipe and 2 whole eggs (also an option). This turned out tasting great, spongy texture, and after the third day in the fridge it is still moist. Not to mention the most fabulous smell in my kitchen. I can't wait to start experimenting with different flavors. I am going to make an herb loaf and a cinnamon roll flavored loaf to see how they turn out. In the meantime, I have great sandwich and french toast bread.\n",

There is no \"burnt sox\" smell to these beans. Its a dark and rich blend with excellent flavor. I have tried several cans of the Kick Ass Dark with no complaints but no real bonding either. The 454 Horse Power Dark is perfect for when a richer, darker, brew with \"wake-up!!\" powers is needed! The beans are nicely dark-roasted & fresh. My 454HP is med coarse ground as needed and done in a french press - yes, I want all the oils & flavors possible! It should provide serious espresso too. Normally, I don't use added condiments to my coffee, but 454HP will be fine for those wanting sugar or cream. I've placed 454HP into subscription!\n",

      "My whole family--especially the eight-year-old--loves these wide rice noodles (chow fun). They are not easy to find outside of a Chinese market, so buying in bulk is a good idea. I love the mouth-feel of rice noodles anyway, and wide is just that much more fun. Plus, they are not flimsy (like rice vermicelli), so are easy to stir-fry. I use a simple Cantonese style, with some soy sauce, some oyster sauce, and a little beef stock. Be sure to use plenty of oil when you stir-fry, as the noodles do absorb it. But your dish will be so beautiful, it's so worth it. Lastly, if you are on a no-gluten diet, you are gonna go ga-ga over these!<br /><br />The directions on the package for presoaking are good--but instead of warm tap water (which has more lead in it from the pipes!) use cold water and warm it in the microwave. Be sure your noodle container is large enough so that the noodles won't stick to each other too much (and you will have to stir from time to time--again, to keep them from sticking). If you have to do something else, you can store the partially softened, drained noodles in the fridge--they'll be fine when you get back. Then saute as usual. Serve quickly so that the noodles don't get mushy. Voila! A fabulous and easy meal with minimal work (just a little advance effort).\n",

      "I purchased this product without reading the reviews beforehand.  However, had I read the reviews I might have been clued in that this product is not what the name claims!  It claims to be Chai Green Tea, but the pictures on the side of the box show that it is in fact 3 different types of teas (i.e.Grey,orange,etc.), not the one actual flavor of 'chai' tea like I had wanted.<br /><br />I bought this product as a holiday gift and if I had the option to send it back I would as I made this discovery while opening the shipment box. I would gladly send it back shrink-wrap intact and all for something else.<br /><br />IMO, 'chai tea' is a specific flavor produced from a blend of spices and based on that I was looking for the 'chai' in this product but didn't find it.<br /><br />I have nothing to add about the actual taste or quality since it is a gift for someone else, but I just thought I would put it out there in case someone else reads this first before buying.\n",

      "I got hooked on these candy bars when I lived in London in the early 90s.  Finally, last spring, during a trip to Epcot Center in Orlando, I found a shop that had Curly Wurly Bars.  I bought 20 of them on the spot.  Little did I know, that by sharing them with my 2 sons, ages 5 and 7, I had created another Curly Wurly addict.  The supply dwindled mysteriously until they were completely gone in a few days.  THAT's how good they are, chewy, chocolatey, and delightful, and definitely worth risking a mother's wrath for.\n",

As most people are aware, there are certain herbs and spices that are better suited for pork, than fish, or chicken than steak.  This really robust blend of garlic and herbs from Tones is one of the most universal spices I have ever used.  I regularly add it to pasta sauce, chicken, steak, hamburgers, roasts, pork, you name it and it tastes great on anything.  One thing I can promise you is that it has a very different flavor to it than you have probably ever experienced from any other common spice, or blend in your kitchen.  It's garlic taste is distinctive, but far from overwhelming.  The herbs come through in its aroma, and more importantly, in the final product that you are using.  This brand and blend is hard to find in stores in any size.  I buy it here regularly on Amazon and highly recommend it for your own kitchen adventures...\n",

Somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Anyway, they kept being available, so I kept ordering them. They got a stale in March, but until then had been just fine. In May they were pretty crumbly. Now it is the end of June. Sadly, they no longer have any taste and when I open one of the little bags they are packaged in, the crumbs fly everywhere. So they were a wonderful treat for 6 or more months. I look forward to next season when I shall start ordering them again. But for this year, this is my final batch.<br /><br />You may have guessed. I LOVE PUMPKIN POT TARTS! I purely love everything PUMPKIN. I think, next to strawberry ice cream, it is my favorite thing in the whole world--at at least when it comes to dessert type things. I can't imagine how many preservatives they must put in these to make them edible from November until July! But, preservatives or not, I shall eat them.<br /><br />On the whole, I totally reccommend these, but not after July of any given year. After that, no taste and a bag of crumbs. But, if you are like I am, and are a Pumpkin Pot Tart addict, then these are great. Go for them!\n",

One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act \"wonky\".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by \"leaps and bounds\" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a \"treat\" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!\n",

I liked it better when I made the pizza crust thin and then cooked for about 10 min before adding toppings then cooking for the remainder, makes a better texture this way, imo.\n",

It can be served either hot or chilled.<br />The price is excellent, and I can get it in quantity so I don't (Heaven forbid!) run out.

(Well, almost.  I insist on using real butter for my chocolate chip cookies)  Its color is a pleasing light yellow-gold with a hint of green.  It is of very consistent quality batch-to-batch and is better and less expensive than what I can find locally.  The taste is smooth and fruity with no bitterness, but mild enough to use as a substitute for butter in most recipes.<br /><br />It is good enough to stand alone with some good french bread and aged balsamic vinegar but inexpensive enough that we use it for all our cooking and sauces.  I like the fact that it comes in a tin that is attractive enough to leave on the kitchen counter and it also protects the contents from light.  the pull out pouring spout meters the oil well and prevents most drips.<br /><br />This presents a very nice balance between quality and price.  There may be better olive oils out there, and certainly less expensive ones, but this one hits the sweet spot between quality and value.\n",

      "I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.\n",

So far, he hasn't put a noticeable mark on it yet and also hasn't popped the treat out of the center. So, I don't know how all these other dogs have managed to destroy their toy or retrieve their treat so fast. As another reviewer stated, I believe the treat ball would probably be best for the \"dumb\" dogs and the Bento ball for the \"smart\" chewers.  But, now at the 3.5 hour mark, my bulldog has tired himself out from chewing on the ball and it is sitting in front of him with noticable marks on the treat surface, but the blue ball still looks brand new (well, with a little slobber on it.)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy for your power chewing dogs!\n",

It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.

We decided to use our remaining bottles in mixed drinks at social events. We are fans, however, of the other flavors we tried, which had just the right amount of sweetness and bite. So, no need to avoid the entire ICE line - just, maybe, this one if you don't like super-sweet drinks.\n",

Now for the flavor...first it's sweet on the tongue, then tangy followed by a spicy finish. It's very good and I had it on a burger since I didn't make taco's last night and it was awesome, better than ketchup or spicy mustard like I normally have on it.

      "The first time I drank this tea, I hated it.  I left it in my tea cabinet and never touched it again.  I drink about 10 cups of green tea a day, and recently, I went to a salon where they were serving free green tea.  I had to take some.  The tea was incredible, and it turns out that it was the exact same tea that I had shunned the first time I tried it.<br /><br />Yes, it has a distinct aftertaste.  It doesn't taste like green tea, in my opinion.  After you swallow it, an incredible taste bursts out and coats your entire throat.  It's truly delicious.  I don't know what herb is contributing to the aftertaste, but I can tell you that I've been drinking this all day and I wish there was an identical loose leaf version.<br /><br />With other teas, I start to feel sick if I drink too much.  This is the only flavor of Yogi tea I've ever tried, and I'm thrilled that I can drink cup after cup without feeling sick.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you don't like it the first time around, give it another shot.  Don't brew the tea at too hot of a temperature -- if the water is boiling, it's too hot.  I brew it at drinking temperature and I dip the bag a few times in the water.  Mmmmmm.\n",

      "I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?\n",

      "We love rice around our house, and have tried a wide variety. We find white rice akin to library paste, and regular brown rice a bit like tree bark. This large bag of brown Basmati has become our favorite, both for flavor and for value. Brown rice has much better nutrition than white, by the way.<br /><br />For those who don't know it, Basmati rice has a delicious aroma even before you start to boil it. The flavor and texture are more interesting than white rice but not as sincerely virtuous as regular brown. The cooking is more like brown than white, however. Allow about 45 minutes, depending on the desired texture.<br /><br />While heating two to four cups water per cup of dry rice, I wash the rice with hot water. You'll see why. Drain and rinse, then add to boiling water and turn the heat to medium until it resumes boiling. After that, medium low will suffice. Frequent stirring is not needed if the heat is appropriate. After 30 minutes, I start to check more frequently.<br /><br />It's really best if you don't season brown rice until it's cooked. Read up on osmosis if it's not immediately clear to you why adding salt to the cooking water prolongs cooking time. Brown rice owes its reputation for being slow to cook almost entirely to recipes that add salt at the beginning (dried beans are the same way).<br /><br />To really tantalize the taste buds, add a tablespoon of Vegeta per cup of dry rice when the rice has reached the texture you like. Stir and let sit five minutes, covered. Mmmmmm!\n",

      "I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other \"b-list\" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the \"kick\" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).\n",

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"bowel tolerance\" or \"happy bowels\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

      "My teenagers love green tea and anything with a funky flavor, so I got them the mango pineapple flavor of this Lipton To Go green tea mix. It's a great way to flavor plain water, which one of my boys hates to drink.<br /><br />They both liked it quite a bit and said it tastes just like the pre-made Lipton green tea bottles you buy in the store. I mixed up half a packet in an 8-ounce glass of water for myself, and it took some time for it to fully dissolve. The color is a bit weird...a yellowy orange. I could taste the mango and the pineapple, but with the honey, it had a bit too much going on for me, flavor-wise. Didn't seem that balanced. I wouldn't make it again for myself, but I'd buy it again for my boys. Flavor is such a personal thing, though, and there are SO many reviews on here with different opinions, so if you're an adventurous sort, try it for yourself. It didn't have a chemical taste to me, just a lot of flavors going on.<br /><br />In reading the other reviews, I don't understand why some people are FREAKING out about there being Splenda in it. So?? Many low-calorie drinks are sweetened with Splenda (sucralose) or Nutrasweet (aspartame), and Splenda is a much better alternative than Nutrasweet. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, then don't get this product! And read the label first...yes, it says there's no aspartame, which may lead people to believe there are NO artificial sweeteners, but a quick glance at the nutrition panel tells you it has sucralose. Those of us who are hypoglycemic appreciate having products with lower sugar available to us, because we have to give up most sweets. If you prefer things with Stevia, then buy unsweetened tea mixes and flavor them yourselves. Toss in a little pineapple juice and honey and knock yourself out. But just because this tea has Splenda doesn't make it a product worthy of scorn. To each his own!\n",

      "My three-year-old Jack Russell/Chihuahua mix is thriving on this food. He has had seizures since I adopted him along with severe skin allergies. Both have stopped completely since starting him on this food. It is the only grain-free food he will eat and it has helped me identify that he does have a grain allergy. He loves it and has actually lost weight on it (for him this is a good thing). He is currently maintaining a healthy weight. He does have a few issues with diarrhea, but has had the same issue on any food we have tried so I do not believe the food is causing it. Also, some of the bags do have Menadione Sodium Bisulfite listing as an ingredient. However, this is not listed as an ingredient on their Web site. From what I have read, they no longer use it and are simply using up old packaging which is very environmentally friendly.<br /><br />[...]\n",

Just opened up a recent case from Amazon and the first two cans out are definately different than what this product has been in the past. It is not white in color, but green/gray, it is also not as 'fluffy'. The rancid / acrid smell is definately present. It smells like a two year old can of holiday nuts that went stale long ago. I am somewhat shocked at the number of reviews and comments that have had a similar issue. The Manufacturer does not list a phone number on their website and e-mail is the only contact method.

I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.\n",

I received some as a gift and was very pleased to find that it is just as good as the Dek.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful in a moka pot and french press. A bit lighter in taste than the Dek, but just as smooth and rich, with a hint more sweetness. Very nice aftertaste. The medium roast lets the flavor through without any harshness or burnt taste.<br /><br />I also tried it as espresso and, while it was good, I prefer the Dek. The Grand Filtro was a bit flat as espresso.<br /><br />Can't beat Lavazza Dek for espresso, and Gran Filtro for pretty much any other type of brewing. Highly, highly recommend!\n",

It is very stubborn and likes to form chunks.  The taste is weird and texture is like drinking wet sand.<br /><br />The energy boost was enough to drive me into several weeks of experimentation.  My best advice is to put this into a smoothie or milkshake of some sort.  It will be a gritty smoothie but still better than attempting to drink it in water or milk.  I have also baked it into cookies which worked out really well.  Strangely enough it levels off the initial sugar rush you'd get from the cookies and you don't experience a crash afterwards.<br /><br />It is interesting stuff to experiment with for sure.

      "I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!<br /><br />After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!<br /><br />I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others<br /><br />Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed\n",

      "I purchased Honeyville Food Products' Powdered Egg Whites for many years directly from Honeyville Farms. During that time, the ingredient labels on the cans have always stated: \"Ingredients: Powdered Egg Whites\" and nothing else. I will say that I love this product. Even cooked in butter as scrambled eggs with just a little salt, it tastes like whole fresh eggs to me.  Definitely no offensive odor or taste.<br /><br />Eariler this week I was going to purchase another can when I happened to look at the ingredients listed on their Web site -- \"Ingredients: Egg Whites, less than 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (added as a whipping aid)\". This came as a great surprise to me, I thought they had started using SLS as an additive. I decided to do some research and couldn't find anything about SLS except that it is used in soaps, shampoos and toothpastes. Nowhere was there a mention of it being in food. I went so far as to question the FDA. Yesterday I wrote the following e-mail to the Director of E-Commerce of Honeyville Food Products, Inc. and received a reply today:<br /><br />\"I have purchased your powdered egg whites for a number of years and have been extremely happy with them. I also purchase some of your other products that do not contain additives or preservatives...<br /><br />I am very unhappy to see that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate has been added (to your powdered egg whites). Although this additive is approved by the FDA, I see little use for it to be in an egg product. I realize SLS has been used for many years in soaps, shampoos and other products that are expected, by the general public, to foam. But, these are products that are used externally and then rinsed off. Even then, SLS is an irritant to some people. I also realize that the FDA requires SLS to be used in lesser amounts where foods are concerned, but when using a product daily as I do the powdered egg whites (for smoothies) I worry about the build-up over time.<br /><br />The only possibility I can see why this additive is being used is because of meringue. I made meringues numerous times with your egg whites and they have always come out high and beautiful -- there was never a need for SLS\".<br /><br />Following is the reply I received today:<br /><br />\"I'm sorry to hear that we've lost you as an Egg White customer.  Our Egg Whites have always had the small amount of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate as a whipping aid.  When Egg Whites are pasteurized they lose the whipping characteristics that fresh egg whites have.  I appreciate the feedback and will weigh it against that of the customers that need the Egg Whites to whip up.  Thanks and have a great day.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Chris Ondatje<br />Director of E-Commerce<br />Honeyville Food Products, Inc.<br />[...]<br />chriso@honeyvillegrain.com<br />(888) 810-3212 ext. 1001\"<br /><br />Well, now I know why my meringues turned out so beautiful -- because of a surfactant used in what I thought was a simple and pure product. I don't want to vilify SLS, I'm just looking for honesty in marketing so I can make a choice.<br /><br />I gave this review only one star because I was not given that choice.\n",

The returns policy is to refuse any return for refund after three days from the date of ordering the product - which with two day shipping means you actually have to open and inspect all twelve bags the day you receive them or you will be unable to get a refund. I did not realize this and tried to return mine, failing to meet this deadline by only forty minutes mind you, and was then stuck paying for twelve bags of stale product. I opened all twelve bags once I realized the first was soggy and stale and there wasn't a good bag in the entire shipment. But because I didn't find this out forty minutes earlier I was just stuck throwing the entire shipment away along with my money. I have ordered this product twice before and it was fresh so did not expect this problem. But now that I realize the impossible inspection/return policy I will not risk this again. Too bad because it really is a good product when it's not stale. I give this one star for the inspection/return policy alone. After all, why would anyone open all twelve bags on day one in the first place? It would just make all the bags go stale right away before you even want to eat them.\n",

      "I have a huge dog and a wee beagle. I won't lie, they would eat anything and have tried. (Well, they won't eat cucumber peelings if they drop on the floor. Weird.) I served them Beneful and they woofed it down, no problem. :)  I do believe that the bag picture and name are misleading, as well as the ad campaign for this dog food. It's not very beneficial for your dog and the top ingredients are total junk and filler. I prefer <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X63VS\">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Senior Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a> but it's way, way more expensive. With Beneful, you are going to see a LOT of waste, so to speak, when your dog `goes for a walk'. There is a belief that if you feed your dog good, quality food, there is less waste because there is so much nutrition being gleaned from the food. I'd say this is true, but not so much less waste that you can..oh...get another dog, or take smaller poo-bags on your walks. (hahaha) This food is more like, homemade play dough. If you took homemade play dough, which is mostly salt, and shaped it into the form of a carrot and a chunk of steak, then ate it, you would still be eating salt, not meat or veggies. Beneful looks like food, but it's mostly junk. Why the four stars? Because I've been feeding my dogs cheap food all their lives, and fed the same kind of food to my passed-on dogs and they all did fine. They all lived to their life's expectancy and beyond. No health issues, ever (except for a dog-ate-a-corncob-incident, which if you think about it, I would not have had with just kibble!) and they had/have energy, healthy teeth, coats that shine etc. Overall, if you can afford better food, I say go for it.\n",

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.

      "I'm super conscious of BPA in products because of a prostate cancer scare with my husband, but I feel great ordering these because these cans have NO BPA in the can lining. General Mills announced in November 2010 it was replacing the can lining in Muir Glen tomato products and would begin using those cans for that year's harvest. It's now a year later, so these cans should be BPA-free.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the tomatoes taste pretty good too! They cost less than the supermarket (especially if you subscribe), and they contain lots of lycopene.\n",

      "Much like the pricier brands I used to buy  this coffee is dark, bold and yet smooth at the same time. I think what attracted me to the coffee was the name, who doesn't want a caffeinated cup of joe with the words \"Kick Ass Dark\" on it? If you have to wake up before the crack of dawn, you want something that will kick your ass out of the pj's and into the work clothes without being bitter or chalky, or making your stomach ache from the acidity. This coffee is our new personal favorite. We've tried a few other flavors by this brand as well and enjoyed them, but Kick Ass Dark has got to be my favorite. Maybe it's just the name, maybe it's the coffeehouse flavor without the coffeehouse price, either way, I would recommend this to anyone.\n",

      "We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.  We think it is worth it.\n",

My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.\n",

It's a nice, gourmet step up from his usual kibble, and he loves the heck out of it. Same goes for a much smaller dog, my friend's tiny little westie terrier Lucy; obviously she gets a lot less, but she has a lot of allergies and intolerances, and this food agrees with her in every way.

      "I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).  The only coffee I've ever had seemed terrible to me (then again, cheap crappy coffee probably really is terrible).  I wouldn't have normally ordered this, but the description sounded so nice and tasty that I decided to give it a try.  I went in not expecting to like it much though.<br /><br />So, I pulled out my boyfriend's tiny coffee pot to brew up some of this coffee.  The first thing that struck me as nice was that each packet of coffee is individually sealed, and each packet is contained in its own little filter (which is very convenient).  When I first brewed up a batch, I accidentally brewed it too weak (I made about 4 cups when the directions say to only make 1 cup).  I liked it a lot anyway; it reminded me of my favorite blend of carob tea.  To be fair to the coffee, though, I decided to brew it again following the directions properly.  It came out stronger (and I didn't enjoy the coffee bitterness as much) but it was still good.  I was able to drink it with only sugar and no creamer to dilute it's flavor.  I must say that in my limited experience, this is the best coffee I've ever tasted, but I think that I much prefer a light brew coffee.<br /><br />So, this is a great coffee for people who don't normally drink coffee.  Would a coffee lover actually enjoy it?  Well, if you like a really strong bitter coffee, then you really wouldn't care for this.  If you like a light or medium strength coffee, then you'll really love this one.  If you are just starting out with coffee drinking, this would be a good one to try out to ease you into it.  I liked it well enough that I'd even consider drinking it regularly along with my tea!  So, if any of this sounds appealing to you, go ahead and give it a try!\n",

      "I started really reading labels on our foods last year when my husband started culinary school.<br />I was appalled at some of the things stuck in our everyday foods so they'll still have taste after<br />being over-processed, fillers to stretch them and chemicals to make them last for a couple years<br />on the shelf.<br /><br />Then I moved on to our cat food.  Same scenario!<br />Cats are carnivores.  Despite how great it sounds to see \"balanced diet\" on the front of<br />our cat food packages, cats do not need the SAME diet that humans do!  They do NOT need grains,<br />especially corn and corn fillers. Yet, you'll see package after package with the main ingredient<br />being corn meal or wheat by products. No wonder our kitties get itchy skin, dull coats and<br />get chubby (fillers fatten them up, just like it does to people!)<br /><br />I thought I'd try this food, because of the fiber content. Our oldest cat was having some problems<br />with constipation. Since he really didn't appreciate the petroleum jelly on a Q-tip to help him out,<br />I started looking for foods or treats that might help. Then I found this food.<br /><br />I would have never imagined a cat would like pumpkin, but they do! This has sort of a pumpkin soup<br />base, with real shredded chicken meat. (I took a photo, but it didn't turn out too great. I'll try<br />again next time I serve it.) Both cats seemed to really take to it, and our littlest cat didn't leave a speck<br />of pumpkin in the bowl. Neither one really seemed to finish off the chicken for some reason.<br /><br />I can't serve this brand all the time, simply because of the cost. I know quality costs more, but it is still<br />a little hard on my budget right now. But, I'll keep getting it when I can, and treating them whenever possible.<br />I'd definitely recommend it.\n",

      "While this is an unprocessed, and good tasting salt, to say that it contains minerals and is good for you is simply misleading. The amounts present in the salt are so low as to be negligible. Lets take a look at the actual mineral content of a few minerals:<br /><br />The potassium content in one serving (1/4 tsp) is 2mg. This is absolutely nothing and equates to less then 0.1% of your daily value. Its the same deal with all the other minerals. Not enough to make any difference whatsoever. Its just like saying my tap water from the faucet contains minerals.<br /><br />This salt doesn't even contain enough iodine to put on the label and isnt nutritionally relevant - they even admit that on the package. I would actually say that regular iodized table salt is more nutritious because it contains 40% or more of your daily value for iodine. Yet people are even claiming it can prevent radiation!? This is absolutely ridiculous and contains nowhere near the amount of minerals to do anything at all. On their website they like to show that bar graph that shows its superior mineral content. We are dealing with parts per MILLION, folks.<br /><br />It really misleads people when they think they can load up on this salt and they think they are being healthy or getting more nutrients. Dont fool yourself. This stuff is SALT. Any lower sodium content is really negligible and honestly its misleading and deceptive to claim that this is \"healthy and doctor recommended\".<br /><br />You would have to eat the entire 1/2 pound package to equal about a fourth of a banana's worth of potassium. So, yes, TECHNICALLY they can claim it contains minerals, but they are being deceptive if they claim it will actually make a difference.<br /><br />As far as taste and texture goes, thats a completely different story and I will personally say it tastes great, but I realize this product for what it is - salt. People attribute these health benefits to sea salt that just are not true, and may end up using even more salt then they would have normally, ultimately being even more unhealthy. This is certainly NOT a salt substitute and is NOT for people with low sodium diets. There seems to be this craze around sea salt because it seems all natural and from the Earth, but its health claims are quite unsubstantiated and many people are being fooled.\n",

I contacted their customer service department and the words \"herbal lift\" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an \"avid cyclist\", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.\n",

It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!\n",

      "This product is great to use if you want to deep condition your hair and scalp with it.  I used the coconut oil along with the Suave Professional hair conditioner, put a plastic cap on my head and sat under the hair dryer for thirty-minutes with the hair dryer on the low setting, and noticed that my hair was much softer and easier to manage.  I have been natural for about a year and six months or longer (without a perm in my hair).  Since I noticed a difference in my hair I wanted to make sure that my hair was softer because of the coconut oil, because I had just started using the Suave Professional conditioner; so when it was time to shampoo my hair again, I put the same conditioner on my hair sat under the hair dryer for thirty minutes with the setting on low as usual without the coconut oil on my hair and noticed that my hair was not as soft as when I used the coconut oil on my hair in addition to the conditioner.  My hair was still soft, not to imply that Suave Professional is not a good conditioner and didn't make my hair soft.  However, my hair seemed much softer when I used the coconut oil and the conditioner on my hair.  It is also great to use on the scalp as well.  Usually when I grease my scalp with sulfur 8 fresh hair & scalp conditioner (in the yellow jar with the blue cap) after washing and conditioning my hair within three to four days I wash and grease my hair again because my scalp no longer feels clean.  Since I started greasing my scalp with the coconut oil first, just a very little on the scalp area, then put the sulfur 8 fresh hair and conditioner on my scalp on the same scalp area where I put the coconut oil, my scalp feels healthier; after only two treatments of greasing my hair with the coconut oil and sulfur 8.  I am assuming that using the coconut oil with any conditioner and any hair grease will make the hair and scalp feel healthier, softer and easier to manage.  I highly recommend using this product or any other coconut oil if you want to use the product to help with the conditioning of your hair and/or scalp.\n",

But she really likes this Beneful Dog Food. It has all the vitamins and nutrition that a dog needs.<br /><br />I also love the bag, it has a zip lock seal on top! Why don't other product do this? It is great at keeping the food fresh and this is especially important when you buy a big bag. It still feels and smells fresh at the bottom of the bag as it did when I first opened it. I'll take Button's word that it still tastes fresh ;)\n",

      "I have to agree with everyone else. I once accidentally purchased the DaVinci Gourmet brand caramel and I remarked to my husband that it tasted like pancake syrup to me. When I bought this though, I was thrilled to be saving money. Imagine my disappointment then when I tried it the very first time. I believe this is the same syrup as the caramel, but with a different label slapped onto the bottle. No, really I do. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the two.<br /><br />Well whatever it is, it is NOT hazelnut.<br /><br />I would recommend the DaVinci Gourmet brand of sugar free Hazelnut OR hazelnut flavored Splenda packets instead. Amazon sells both DaVinci and Splenda, but neither have super saver shipping at the time of this writing. You have to balance for yourself whether or not the extra money is worth it to you.\n",

      "I have 2 wonderful felines that I consider my babies....but the hairball throw-up was everywhere, they weren't feeling good when it was preparing to come up and it was getting expensive to clean up!!  I've only had this product for about a month and already I'm seeing A LOT of improvement!!!  I'm soooo happy for them and for me!!!  First, my girl kitty is super picky and my guy kitty will eat just about anything but the consistency of this product took them both for a loop.  They wouldn't lick it off my finger or in a bowl with treats or put on their paws either.  So, I tried putting it in their wetfood (they get part of a can for one meal per day for many other reasons but mainly bc of my picky eater kitty).  I lay the wetfood in a layer in their bowl, squeeze the laxatone in the center & fold the outer edges of the wetfood over the center filled laxatone.  They also preferred the regular malt flavor to the tuna one which is interesting bc they prefer all their wetfood to be seafood flavors.  You just have to try different ones and se what your cats will prefer, I guess.  It took them about a week to get used to it but I stuck with it and now they eat it no problem.  I had my concerns that it wouldn't work as well being given with their wetfood but as I said...I've already seen a HUGE difference...where I had to clean up the hairball throw-up normally up to several times a week...now, within the month or so that I've been giving it to them, I've only had to clean it up twice in one whole month!!  I know it'll get even better as I continue to give it to them.  Not only that but they are eating better and I can tell they feel better bc their bathroom movements are much healthier looking (hey, only a mom can say this without cringing and be sincerely happy about this, right?!) and they are moving around with a lighter bounce in their step bc they aren't throwing up as much any more either.  Really glad that my sister, the vet, told me about this product!  And really glad that someone invented a product like this!!\n",

      "Unlike the Quaker Oat squares I recently reviewed (q.v.) (thanks, Vine, for giving me breakfast stuff!), when Nature's Path says vanilla, they MEAN vanilla. Bold, brash, and almost creamy, if you can imagine that in a puffed-grain cereal (I can't either, but it's the only way I can think of to describe the forwardness of the vanilla here). But then there's that \"puffed-grain cereal\" thing. You get to thinking that a puffed grain is a puffed grain, whether it's rice or quinoa. Lemme tell you something, bub: that ain't true. While the texture here is consistent despite the variety of grains, this has a lighter (forgive me for using this phrase, which I despise, but I can't think of another that makes sense) mouth feel than your good old fashioned rice krispies or whatever.<br /><br />[amusing note: Chrome's spell-check-error-on-a-real-word of the day: quinoa.]<br /><br />I powered through this box in two days, despite knowing that I wouldn't be having it again for a while (save these last Vine reviews of breakfast stuff I'm going low-carb for a spell). Been mulling it over ever since, and I can't think of a better-tasting cereal I've ever had. But to be on the safe side, since I don't remember all the kinds of sickeningly-sweet cereal I ate as a kid (as a yardstick, when I was growing up, we still had sugar smacks, sugar corn pops, and all the other cereals that compared to today were paragons of truth in advertising), I'll say this one's definitely in the top five. Were I not going low-carb I would be perfectly content to eat this stuff for breakfast every day for the rest of my life. It's THAT good. *****\n",

      "I love tea.  I especially love green tea.  I also love passion fruit (they flavor everything with that these days, don't they) and I really love the soothing pallet cleansing quality of aloe vera.  So, I was particularly pleased to get to try this Chan Tea product; this green tea infusion.  I'll start by warning that this looks really unappealing upon receipt and that judging from the large amount of floating debris (pulp) and the murky green color one may be almost repulsed by the presence of this product.  That said; I had to try it, so I did and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, this really doesn't taste anything like green tea or passion fruit, but there is a familiarity to the flavoring so maybe the subtle hints are sparking memories on my tongue.  What I will say is that the flavor is solid, with no aftertaste at all and the sweet levels are balanced to the point where this tastes fresh and authentic and organic and, well, sort of delicious.  The texture of the drink can be a little off putting, considering that there is so much pulp your constantly rolling balls off the roof of your mouth.  Still, there is substantial flavor here so give it a whirl and see what you think.\n",

And the flavor is superb; I don't know if they slow-brew it, or what, but whatever they do is perfect.  It gets and A+ from me!<br /><br />This particular tea is the original type.  There are other varieties in which there are added flavors, such as peach, lemon, etc, and I do love those, too, but my favorite type is the original.  And the reason is, I love to taste the tea without any other flavors in the way.  Now don't get me wrong, like I said earlier, I do love the flavored teas, also, and I do drink them.  But this original variety is my favorite of them all, so, therefore, I do drink this type the most (but I also drink the others).  I love to be able to just taste the tea and no other flavors, because, to me, tea itself is an awesome flavor.<br /><br />I guess anybody can brew tea, but I do think this brand is the best I've ever had that is store-bought.

      "When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.\n",

      "First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.\n",

Why go to the store and lug a 30 lb bag of dogfood around when you get get it shipped to your house 2 day mail for free.<br /><br />So, if you're skeptical of buying dogfood on Amazon- don't be!

I also noticed that when I purchased Wellness my dog had the WORST gas ever.  THis does NOT give my dog bad gas.  I do notice that the dogs eyes are a little gunky (which I heard can be attributed to their food) but not more gunky then when I was giving them the Costco Nature's Domain Salmon and sweet potato.

The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However, if you are on a diet, this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein.\n",

      "These are pretty good and close to the real deal for frozen cheesesteaks. I live in South Philly, very close to Pat's and Geno's actually, and have eaten them both, in addition to Jim's on South.  While I unfortunately haven't been to Tony Luke's on Oregon, I purchased these as a gift for my father in FL to have authentic South Philly cheesesteaks.  None of the other native South Philly cheesesteakers offer their product through mail order, so Tony Luke's was it. and honestly, I enjoyed these better, or at the very least n par with the unfrozen fresh versions that I've tried.  In fact, these now have me wanting to try a fresh Tony Luke version as well just for comparative purposes.<br />The steaks arrived pretty quickly. They are fulfilled through Rastelli, the frozen meat cataloguers.  And lucky for me, they accidentally sent me two.  The boxes they arrive in are pretty big, but that's to ensure that's to fit the styrofoam and dry ice to keep the product cold and frozen.  Beyond that, the rolls are individually packaged separately from the individual vac packs of meat and cheese. Rolls are heated in the oven and meat packs are boiled up to heat.  Put 'em together and it's as fresh as you'll get.<br />One cautionary note, when adding the meat to roll, make sure to drain liquid from the pack before, as to not soggify the roll. Learned my lesson. Otherwise mmmm... Pretty damn good.  Add fried onions for that extra authentic add.\n",

      "It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.\n",

      "This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of \"menadione sodium sulfite in pet food\" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.\n",

The subtle scent and flavor of jasmine is just right, and added with a bit of lemon (increases the anti-oxidants!) and honey, you have the perfect cup of hot tea.  Even better, make a large cup and leave the tea bag in longer, refrigerate the extra, and you have a great iced tea to go with your lunch or dinner.

The first sip was like falling in love. I literally felt heady. The only thing I added was a little half & half and two packets of stevia. I would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert. This is truly an exceptional coffee! I'm beyond impressed.

So a small portion of the three stars above (which would be 2.5 if I could) comes from the fact that it was difficult to find a whole cracker in the box. (If this happens to you, do what we did: use them as crumb topping on a casserole).<br /><br />Second: At 5 dollars a box, they ring in at nearly twice the price of the same product at my local grocery...so you should probably check out your local grocery if you need to get your cheez-it fix.<br /><br />Now, on to the flavour--we didn't get creamy or mozzarella from these. They tasted fine...just not like the cheese whose name they wear. (The best flavours are original, the duoz with the smoked cheese flavour, and Swiss). There is too the problem of powdery residue on your fingers after snacking...a big plus of the original flavour is a total lack of this (and a much more cheesey flavour).\n",

I don't use it directly unless I am adding to soups or chili but warning, you only need drops.  If you have not purchased it, I recommend you tooth pick test it first.<br /><br />I add  mine to Texas Pete's with a little garlic power, some ginger and other spices to make a nice custom blend hot sauce.  I highly recommend using a few drops into your own store sauce versus using from the bottle.  Unlike some of the other ghost chili sauces, especially those darker pepper sauces, this one does not have the bitter taste that can ruin your custom sauce blends.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

      "We have a two spoiled dogs who really enjoy their treats.  While they are somewhat like pigs when it comes to their extra dietary choices, they have been known to show greater enthusiasm for some.  We have also found that so many of these treats on the market are unhealthy and mostly comprised of fillers and junk.  We decided to try the Newman's Own because it was organic (which we like for ourselves so we thought it would also be good for our treasured pets), and it looked like it was a total package healthy choice treat.  We have also used other Newman's Own products for our personal food selections and have never been disappointed.  These treats quickly became the favorite choice for our dogs.  Our English Setter began salavating as soon as we opened the package.  If these don't make your dogs wag their tails in appreciation nothing will.  I have even thought of trying one myself, but whenever I open the package the dogs come running and since I don't allow them to eat my treats I would feel bad to eat theirs.\n",

I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)\n",

      "For last night's movie, I though I'd try something a little different. I had a copy of \"Beetlejuice\" which I picked off the bargain rack at a nearby Ross Store. It was a Tim Burton movie. Hmmmm. Tim Burton has turned out some really weird movies and some of them I haven't particularly cared for. Well, \"Beetlejuice\" was weird, all right, but it was also funny in a bizarre fashion. For example, how could you set up an attractive and enjoyable couple and then make their death by automobile accident funny? Well, they did it and it involved a small dog. Or how could you have a movie dwelling on death and the thereafter and have an underworld waiting room of dead people being processed to their next place. Oh, and with an incompetent staff. It's bizarre! And funny. Especially the dismembered lady who was in two parts sitting side by side or the guy with the shrunken head. What kind of people dream this kind of stuff up? Keep on alert when watching a Tim Burton movie, for a lot of the humor is strictly visual. You'll see some of the strangest things, including visual puns.<br /><br />In any case, a delightful young newly-married couple were fixing up an old New England manor, but had a fatal automobile accident nearby. Their ghosts (which could be seen by no one) returned to their house, but were confined to the home and could not go outside. Of course, the house was eventually sold and a new couple, together with a goth teenage girl, moved in. The ghosts tried everything to scare the new intruders away but with negative results. Finally, they enlisted the services of Beetlejuice, a renegade ghost himself, and somewhere along the line, the ghost couple made friends with the goth teenager, who was able to see them. Well, this story has so many weird twists and turns I couldn't possibly keep it straight. It's about the most strangely unfolding plot I can ever remember seeing.<br /><br />I found the movie interesting, somewhat humorous and somewhat enjoyable. Most certainly, it was a very strange spectacle to watch. It was within the subject of horror movies, but there was no horror. It was funny. However, I'm just not into the supernatural and the afterlife and things of that sort, so I probably missed a lot of the subtle humor that would be picked up by people who are so immersed. The movie is complex enough and fast moving so I'd have to watch it several times in order to pick up on all the subtle twists and turns. It's classic Tim Burton, I'll say that.<br /><br />Gary Peterson\n",

I like to give them as gifts. And with the many flavors and the perfect potful size makes it a very easy gift idea.<br /><br />I got it in excellent condition. I used the Subscribe and Save and saved 15% off the price, which made it only $10. And for 12oz. of good tasting coffee, it's a bargin. I'm very happy with my order.\n",

The dressing is perfect in that it is not too sweet and just tangy enough to make eating a salad a total taste bud pleasure. I highly recommend this dressing. It is fabulous!!!\n",

Also can use this product to serve friends who are not so hard-core in their eating habits, sometimes adding a portion of regular or almond flour to a recipe. This Red Mill product differs from specific Atkins mixes in the \"whole grain\" feature so it depends on the high fiber to provide low net carbs. Experimenting has shown me that a little extra egg can help produce the best texture; don't skimp on the leavening!\n",

      "I figured I would give Larabar a try since I want to cut down my chips/cookie snacking on those late afternoon. I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and \"oily\" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the \"core\" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack.\n",

Everyone is different but this product has by far worked the best for me at keeping myself going on those long or difficult rides, hikes, cross country ski and snowshoe outings. This also helps to prevent cramping and bonking on those hot humid days when your tend to lose more fluids. I've only had the cool citrus flavor as that is the flavor I've used for years with other hydration products as well, and the flavor though a bit sweet for me is more than acceptable. While cycling I always alternate between a bottle of Cytomax and one of water. For other activities where I carry only one bottle I use a little less the recommended amount of powder per X ounces of water. This product like others like it, require a bit more time to mix than the original hydration powders, but it's more than worth the few extra seconds it takes to get it to properly mix.\n",

      "I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.\n",

      "When Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam(Alec Baldwin) Maitland move out into the country, they have rest and relaxation on their mind. Not even the well-meaning but intrusive antics of uber-realator Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) can rattle their spirits.<br /><br />...until they discover that they died on an old country bridge near their house after a dog stopped balancing a broken bridge beam. After 'somehow' returning to their house, the Maitlands discover the 'Handbook for the recently deceased' and attempt to decipher it.<br /><br />The plot thickens when the Detzes move in from New York; Jane finally was able to sell their house. Delia (Catherine O'Hara) fancies herself an artist, but husband Charles (Jeffery Jones) just wants to relax in the country after having survived stressful city life. Both he and gothic daughter Lydia (Winnona Ryder) are the most likeable ones in this family.<br /><br />After their own attempts at the supernatural fail, the Maitlands call up Beetlejuice, a disgruntled former bureaucrat for the living impaired. Because their caseworker will not help them get rid of the Detzes, the Maitlands soon turn to Beetlejuice for assistance. The Maitlands want their house back, and do not want to become circus attractions for Lydia's equally loopy friends.<br /><br />Otho (Glen Shadix) is in this play only to show that some people really only talk big. During the supernatural ceremony he puts on an attitude of being in charge 'until something goes wrong'. Since it's likely that he was reading this ceremony as he went along, Otho had not known what he was doing. In other films, this would be dangerous for everybody within a close radius, but Beetlejuice comes to save the day.<br /><br />Michael Keaton steals the show as a fast/smooth-talking demon. He's not an angel, but you definitely want him on your side when the chips are down. The only thing he is really scared of is sandworms (in the otherworld). Keaton would later continue to work with Burton on the first two Batman movies, as of now considered the best in that series.<br /><br />Despite the gothic/gloomy tone of this film, it does end on a happy note. The Maitlands and the Detzes end up living together in the same house and Lydia actually gets along with the former couple.\n",

Usually my go to source is coffee, but depending on the level of energy I need, several cups might be the answer. But that answer has me going to the bathroom more than I have time for. So I was pleasantly surprised when I drank a 5 Hour Energy instead. I had more than enough energy to make it all the way to bedtime! I never felt bogged down or sluggish at any point. & I had zero issues when it came to falling asleep. Not to mention not having to stop to use the bathroom every 30 minutes.

Cats loved it over all the other 'meat only' brands...<br /><br />Only problem was... soft stools...  Talked to the vet and she said that sometimes cats need some form of fiber, even if it isn't nutritious, it helps to bulk up the stools and get rid of the God awful odor...<br /><br />So went up and down the food aisle and this particular brand/version had the highest fiber content of all of the bags of food.  The BWC food has 3.5% fiber... This indoor cat food has 10% fiber... yes it is indigestible corn... that's the whole idea... a form of roughage to helps the bowels.  This food also has added fiber on top of the corn stuff etc...<br /><br />So I'm going to see if this helps with the soft very stinky stools... if it does, I'm sticking with it.<br /><br />So far the cats haven't seemed to mind the larger kibble size.

I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.\n",

      "Although the 1.5 Liter size is a bit too large to carry around conveniently, the water does taste good. What I liked about it was that it was not carbonated, it was smooth, and it did not leave an aftertaste.<br /><br />I really don't think that the pH of water is going to change your overall body health, but many like to think that the water they are drinking is pure and free of nonessential elements. The makers claim that Essentia has a special electrolyte formula but it is difficult to analyze this without a comparative chemical analysis.<br /><br />The important thing to remember is that getting plenty of fluid is very important to overall hydration. It is felt that water is the preferred fluid (vs soda, coffee, tea, alcohol, flavored drinks, gatorade, etc.) Drinking the proper amount of water, in addition to other beverages in moderate amounts, every day will help you to be more healthy and lose or maintain weight so make sure you know how much you need!<br /><br />Instructions to determine basic overall fluid need per day:<br /><br />  1)  Weigh yourself and write down your weight.<br />  2)  Take the number of pounds you weigh and multiply that by 2/3.<br />  3)  That is the number of ounces you should drink everyday. The conversion is: 30 mL to one ounce.<br />  4)  For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, two thirds of that is 100 and that is how many ounces you should drink daily. So that would be 3000 mL or 3 Liters of FLUID.<br />  5)  Add 12 ounces of water for every 30 minutes you work out.<br /><br />If you are under the care of a health care professional or have conditions that alter your fluid need from the average person, please seek advice.<br /><br />So, if drinking this particular brand of water helps to make sure you have adequate fluid intake because you like it more than tap water or other bottled water -- go for it!\n",

We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again.

Next I broke off a bit, thinking, ok, soft, usually means butter or shortening, so I didn't expect the cookie to crumble...ok, I was disappointed right there, but the real disappointment came at the first bite.  I don't know, but this did not taste like any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted....no cinnamon or brown sugar flavor, just....well, kind of sawdusty.  I couldn't make out the almond and barely tasted the chocolate.  I think on every level this cookie was not a winner.  If I was absolutely desperate to eat something I would probably eat one I suppose, but I definitely would not buy these.<br /><br />Overall, no taste, terrible texture and a disappointment from start to finish.

      "You don't expect healthy food to be addictive, you certainly don't expect to consider making a special run to the grocery store for granola bars... but these granola bars will do it to you.<br /><br />Now sure I love my chocolate chip granola bars as much as the next person, but one day someone handed me one of these and I've been sold ever since.  I don't know why... maybe the toasty oats and grains, or the honey or maybe its just the fun crunchyness of it all.

      "I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs. He'd also run around having only half-swallowed the treat and I worried about him choking. These treats were recommended to me by a friend and they have solved these problems.<br /><br />PROS<br />-- Our dog loves these treats. LOVES them. Mostly because they are so moist and chewy.<br />-- Even though they are chewy, the treats don't leave any residue on your hands or anything-- they are very clean.<br />-- quick and easy to chew. Seems to be a lot less unhealthy than many other treats out there.<br />-- definitely gets him to pay attention!<br /><br />CONS<br />-- you have to be careful of leaving the bag open as the treats can dry out, although I think you can put a damp napkin in and re-hydrate the treats.<br />-- These are a little too expensive for regular use, especially if you have a bigger dog.<br /><br />Our dog is medium sized and it is easy to go through these treats pretty quickly. Then again, you really need treats that a dog will go wild for, and these do the trick. Overall, these are great treats that we'd recommend to anyone that is looking for high quality dog treats. When he finishes his training for the day we toss a small handful of these around he floor and let him hunt them all down (he is a terrier so he loves it!).\n",

They seem to like this more than the major supermarket retailer stuff, and complain when I don't fill their bowls fast enough. I have to store the food in a lidded bucket, otherwise they will go foraging for themselves and gorge themselves silly. The only way this could be better is if it were offered on a subscription basis.\n",

If you're planning on cooking with these (or putting them in a pasta as I am), you don't need to add any salt to your dish.  The container is great though!<br /><br />The container is labelled:  Refrigerate after opening.  I hadn't planned on refrigerating these, but perhaps I should.  Anyhow, if you're ordering them, make room in your fridge for a container about the size of a pickle jar from the bulk foods section.<br /><br />As far as flavor... try to imagine your standard green (Spanish) pimento-stuffed olive but using a a black olive.  These are not mild - very strong vinegar flavor.\n",

      "I can't say anything about the quality, taste, texture, touch, smell, substance or general quality of this product. Unfortunately, I found out only after ordering and receiving this product that it was \"manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts and soy.\" While I appreciate the fact that the manufacturers mention this on the packaging, it would have helped me greatly to have this information noted on the product information page. I just now checked the Amazon page again and there is no mention of this incredibly important information. For those of you without family members that suffer from peanut and tree nut allergies, go for it, but for the many of us that do live with these challenges, steer clear of this product. I would also hesitate to purchase any other products from this manufacturer without first verifying with them that product was not manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts. !!!Wait!! Just checked their website and there's not a single reference to allergens (other than gluten) in their products. Actually, they seem to have a rather ample offering of products of gluten-free goods, but this does little for those with other allergies. Lastly, I don't expect every product to be free of peanuts and tree nuts, but I do expect the manufacturer to make it known to me if they have these ingredients in their products or are using a facility where these ingredients are used in other products. Unfortunately, Bob's Red Mill has done neither for their website or for their product page on Amazon. While I could return the product in another box (original one was already thrown out), it is too much trouble/hassle to do so. Thanks Bob!!\n",

      "While you normally think of hot oatmeal mixes when you think of Quaker, I think of their awesome Oatmeal Squares cereal.  A long time favorite, the super dense smaller squares of cinnamon based heaven are surprisingly good for you too. 46 grams of whole wheat per serving, providing a whopping 20% of your Daily Value for Dietary Fiber.  And unlike many other cereals, the ingredient list is a pleasant surprise.  Whole grain oat flour and then whole wheat flour are the first two ingredients.  And no high fructose corn syrup either, just good ole brown sugar and regular sugar.  Cinnamon and molasses round out the flavor ingredients.  And sugar only makes up 9 grams per serving- the same as the more expensive and worst tasting Kashi Cinnamon Harvest <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1YYLW\">Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest, 16.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> I bought as a comparison.<br /><br />In fact the Quaker pretty much destroyed the Kashi on the taste test.  It also held up better in milk longer, and the smaller denser squares compared favorably to the bigger looser Kashi squares which crumbled more more easily in the box.  Fiber was a tie, with the Quaker having an extra gram of soluble fiber.  Fat wise the Quaker does have 2.5 grams to 1 gram for the Kashi- but we are still talking 4 and 2% respectively of the Daily Value- so they are both good choices.<br /><br />Downsides- the box is smaller than most at 14.5oz versus 17.5oz for the Kashi.  And its expensive- at nearly $5 a box on Amazon.  But with free delivery and no sales tax its probably close to a wash versus your supermarket. And you will probably eat more than one \"serving\" per meal, so you can blow through a box quicker than you would think.<br /><br />So one of my favorite cereals with Amazon convenience, now I just would like to see the Amazon price come down a bit more to reflect the quantity we are buying.  But for the cereal itself, I can give an unqualified 5 star rave- its great tasting and good for you to boot.\n",

The 20 ounce bags are about the same price or a little less than the grocery price ... and then there's the free shipping too. Can't go wrong with this offering. The local Fred Meyer sold this item (and the organic SB alternative) for $5 less per bag a few weeks ago, but I can't get them anymore locally, so Amazon it is.<br /><br />These larger bags are great for travel -- I take along a French press coffee pot and anywhere I can get boiled water I can have a nice cup of fresh and steamy French Roast, no electricity needed. French roasted coffee is dark, rich, fragrant, and robust -- all with less acidity than most other coffees, and it is good for your liver too, but most of all, \"yum\".\n",

In general, this meal has definitely been her favorite of the veggies and fruits she has tried.<br /><br />As a mother, I love the convenient packaging.  The squeezable pouch and twist-off cap make dispensing the food very easy.  The cap on the pouch is re-sealable, which is great for storage or traveling.

As per usuall the grape, apple juice content seems to always dominate in fruit drinks (unless they're suppose to taste like grapes or apples). The calories and carbs only seems high but in reality compared to a regular soda drink it is much worse since the quantity is greatly reduced in these drinks (Switch brand can 8.3oz regular can 12oz). They however make no pretensions of being a health drink with the exception of their pure juice declaration.

But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!\n",

      "I am a big fan of Krusteaz muffin mixes -- I usually bake several dozen once a month or so (oat bran and fat-free banana are my favorites), then freeze them and have a couple for breakfast every morning (I nuke them on high for about 10 seconds each and they are ready).  I had never tried this kind before as it's not one my local grocery stores carry, so I bought a case from amazon.  The first time I baked them, they smelled AMAZING in the oven and I was looking forward to trying them.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the taste -- they were just very, very, very bland.  They tasted to me somewhat like vanilla muffins (I can't taste anything like almonds in them), but actually they didn't have much of a taste at all.<br /><br />With my second box, I added frozen mixed berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries) to the mix -- I think about a cup or cup and a half of the berries (no need to defrost them first).  This improved the taste quite a bit, so I think this muffin mix just needs SOMETHING added.<br /><br />I will continue to add fruit (maybe nuts too at some point) to the 10 boxes I have left, but I doubt that I will order any more.  I really wanted to like these and am surprised no one else mentioned how bland they are.  (Maybe it's just me.)\n",

I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and \"operate\" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!\n",

      "I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse \"overdose\" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!\n",

      "Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.\n",

      "I say surpisingly because the ingredients were sort of unusual - Cinnamon was one of the main flavors and 1 of my dogs is picky.  All three of them took off with them as if they were special treats, and I had wanted to try them because one of my dogs is on a diet, and this was a low-fat treat.  Unfortunately, there were only 7 in the package, so it's doubtful I'll be buying them again.  I prefer the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU\">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, because although they are smaller in size, they lasted about as long as this treat, and they weren't all gone after the 2nd one.  Still, The ZOE Low Calorie Chew Sticks would be great for a household that had fewer dogs.\n",

Imagine drinking coconut juice and adding a bit of sour and a bit of sweet -- that's what this is.  Some people may like it, but it's just not good in my opinion.  To me, it seems like Vita had a bunch of excess juice from other products and decided to just mix it all together with a splash of coconut.<br /><br />It's not worth the regular price, and not even worth the sale price (I purchased these for under ten dollars for the pack of 12).\n",

I could not find a single super-market brand that was free of both gluten and MSG. These bags are 3oz and most of the \"regular\" jerkey bags in the stores are around 3.75 oz. In my stores, the bags are usually around $5, maybe $4 if you're lucky, and with Amazon's average pricing on this it comes out to be about $5.50 a bag. So a little bit smaller and a little bit more pricey but I think it's WELL worth it for organic beef with no MSG, not to mention the perk of no gluten that is necesary for so many these days. Next time I'm going to try the BBQ flavor. The Teriyaki is great for us but very mild, so depending on what you are looking for if you want a big flavor punch you may want to try a different flavor.\n",

      "... well, actually you can but the results will be something less than stellar.  Well, imagine someone did that and then complained about the quality of the nails they received.  That is what is happening with some (but not all) of the bad reviews here.<br /><br />Coffee pods are made for coffee pod machines.  They are not made for use as \"teabags with coffee\" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI\">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the \"Keurig workaround\" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.  Overall, a solid coffee experience.\n",

It has a hint of sweetness and vanilla.

I did notice this mate is slightly more smokey/strong than what I was accustomed to, so I simply decreased the amount I used; the result was the same great tasting mate I was accustomed to before with my packets. I'm going to save a lot of money having begun to purchase in bulk instead. Anybody with a taste for Yerba Guayaki mate will appreciate this product but I suggest using less in your tea-ball because it is stronger and you don't need to use as much for a great cup of mate.

I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt.

Any suggestions or recommendations i would surely love to hear them<br /><br />I still gave this product 4 stars because i think it is great and has huge potential. Like i said i've taken several high quality mag supplements for years and none of them stopped leg cramps and muscle spasms, eye twitches so quickly.It did give me better sleep but not the best but i'm sure that comes with time. The pills i was taking were big horse pills and i didn't take them alot because of the size. I am taking this because of my Vitamin D deficiency that i just can't seem shake, although it's only been 7 months. You have to have Magnesium for Vitamin D to absorb properly. This does loosen your stools some, but i've never had a problem in that area, thank goodness.<br /><br />I am open to suggestions about the dosage.

I have real matcha from Japan that I use for drinking in the traditional manner. I can taste the difference easily, plus this powder is from Taiwan. That being said, 10oz for this price is a bargain if you are using it in a culinary manner or for lattes or smoothies. The packaging is very nice and keeps the tea fresh and closed off. Just remember to put it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer.\n",

      "I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />\"At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.\"<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. \"Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,\" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  \"These things tend to be wolfed down,\" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. \"They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.\"  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  \"At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,\"<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary.\n",

      "These casings weren't bad.  I generally buy from my local butcher but they were out, so these were what I bought. To work with, they weren't too terrible.  The ones from my butcher are a bit easier to handle, but, then again the ones I get from them aren't packed in a ton of salt either.<br /><br />Oh yeah speaking of the salt, make sure you really rinse these bad boys well.  On the package it says soak for 30 minutes, but at 30 minutes these weren't ready. I let soak an hour in tepid water, changing the water twice.  The runs are quite long, which I appreciated.  The day I used them I made 10lbs of chicken sausage.<br /><br />FYI, for those who use collagen: I started out on collagen because it was just easier to work with.  I gradually moved to natural because of the taste (they do taste better after cooking!) So while I did have to learn to use a more delicate hand with natural, for me it was worth learning.  So there's a tradeoff that each cook has to decide on.<br /><br />And out of all the sausage I made, I only had 2 major breaches.  In my book, thats not exactly terrible, because shit happens.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.\n",

We've tried just about every feta available to US consumers and this is the absolute best we have found so far -- smoother, creamier, and seasoned the best.  Far better than Bristol Farms, Trader Joe's, or any other grocery store selection.  This is the stuff whether you use it on salads, in scrambled eggs, or just as a table cheese.  I think the difference may be that this feta doesn't seem to be brined which can oddly dry out, mush up, and give the cheese a completely different texture than this brand.  Highly recommended!\n",

I have heard that it isn't safe to drink from cans that have dents, so I had to research the risk and check out each can for the location of the dents. I contemplated sending them back, but have decided it is most likely safe to drink. Still, this isn't what I had in mind: to drink a beverage that is supposedly good for one's health while being concerned about the remote possibility of botulism! In the future, please package this product properly so it arrives in flawness condition.\n",

      "This is the best value in K-Cup hot chocolates by far among all brands.  It costs a mere 33 cents per K-Cup for what I paid on Amazon.  Green Mountain makes great coffees, but this product is rather anemic in cocoa taste, and it is not as sweet as some other brands.  This is either good or bad depending on you taste, of course.<br /><br />Now here are some tips to improve the taste:<br /><br />1) Shake the K-Cup prior to use in order to minimize clumping.<br />2) Use the lowest amount of water setting on your machine.<br />3) After the brew cycle ends, tear open the top cover and empty out the left over cocoa into your mug.  (You'd be surprised how much cocoa is left in there--therefore wasted if you don't do this.)<br />4) Add a splash of milk for extra richness, and sugar for sweetness (optional).<br />5) Enjoy!\n",

      "As a celiac, I'm always keen on finding new gluten-free treats, so I was very excited to order these chocolate ginger cookies from Lazy Day Foods. I was a little surprised they were manufactured in Scotland, but they seemed fresh enough upon arrival. The chocolate had melted somewhat in-transit so that the cookies were stuck together, not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />The combination of ginger and chocolate is a bit unusual but I kinda like it, especially since the ginger taste is fairly muted. The chocolate is a medium-dark, not especially bitter but certainly deeper than most mass market chocolates, and it overpowers the ginger. The texture is crispy and the cookies crumble fairly easily, so they're suited to dipping in tea or cocoa.<br /><br />Altogether it's not a bad cookie, but it is a special-interest item and is priced accordingly. I may get these for a special occasion but it won't be a regular purchase.\n",

      "And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.\n",

      "The first time we ordered the Clif Kid Twisted Fruit Ropes we ordered the Variety Pack to sample all the flavors so we could make a better decision when ordering the next pack.  While my seven-year-old enjoyed every flavor very much, strawberry came out slightly ahead in taste.  This time when we received the strawberry-only pack he was thrilled to have a whole box of his favorite but still hoped for a bit of variety.  While he is an avid fan of the flavor of these fruit twists, I am a fan of the ingredients and am happy to serve them to him.  The wholesome ingredients of the Strawberry flavor are as follows: Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, Colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.<br /><br />These fruit twists make a great alternative to the fruit snacks his friends seem to always get in their lunchbox but are a much healthier choice.  If my son is not able to finish his lunch (which seems to be the case most days with the school's 10-15 minute time allotment for lunch) after school during pick-up he will take the fruit twists out of his lunchbox and the other children beg him to trade with him.  Most times he refuses because he enjoys them so much.  I will be re-buying these and packing these in his lunch every once in awhile for a treat.  However, when ordering again I will probably choose the Variety Pack as you get a 24 pack for the same price as a single flavored 18 pack.<br /><br />My personal opinion of the product's flavor is that it is delicious but a bit too sour/tart/tangy.  I can't eat them on a regular basis but my child who loves sour/tart fruit and the occasional sour candy says it is perfect.  Additionally, the product does have a tendency to stick to the teeth.  My child's molars are sealed and he has never had a cavity so it is not an issue for our family but may be something to consider in your purchase.\n",

      "For those of you looking to buy this, don't wait any longer and pull the trigger. Why? Because in the end, it will save you money. Any gum lover who likes these jumbo packs can tell you that at your local grocer, these things cost you $3.59 each PLUS tax.<br /><br />on Amazon, they are $9.99 for a pack of 4.  Divide 9.99 / 4 and you can get each 60-piece container for $2.50. Even if Amazon charges you sales tax for your state, you still end up saving $1 per container.<br /><br />So go ahead and buy this 4-pack of Eclipse gum with 240 pieces of delicious gum. By buying it now, you have $4 to save on other things, like a quick lunch at your local fast food place.<br /><br />Highly recommended!\n",

Be warned that the main ingredients in QBubble's boba mixes are sugar, tea mix, powdered dairy creamer (which probably means trans fats), and flavoring (whatever that may entail)- overall not the ingredients that indicate a healthy drink.<br /><br />The Lavender flavor itself is interesting. To me, it tastes similar, but not the same, as Earl Gray tea with cream.  If you don't like Earl Gray, I would suggest avoiding Lavendaer Boba tea.\n",

      "The better the coffee, the higher the price. So, even tho they say this coffee is grown in high areas of the world, dont bet it contains coffee beans from the hawaian volcanos, Jamaican mountains, or the Ethiopian highlands, even tho the coffee bag says the \"High Grown Beans\" are harvested from the \"Finest coffee producing regions around the world\" . Its 100% arabian coffee, like a lot of the coffee at the grocery store. It's got a great vanilla scent and aftertaste, but then again, its naturally and artificially flavored. So if you are a conneseseur of the finest coffees, and finest flavorings, you'll probibly pick up on this divergence between what the bag claims, and what the Amazon discription claims. However, if your palette is not so discerning, you'll not spot the difference. From my standpoint, MELITTA's PARISIAN VANILLA produced a good, solid cup of \"desert coffee\". It's smooth enough, but you'll probibly want to add sweetener and some cream or milk, to bring out the vanilla flavoring.  It did drink well, to the bottom of the cup, without becoming bitter. (Milk tends to keep Cafe au Lait from becoming too bitter, tho.) It smells wonderful, by the way.\n",

      "The Dutch process is a better process since apparently it is suppose to retain more antioxidants than the American process but Dutch is more expensive. I mix the isolate with un-hulled organic sesame seed, organic flax seed, Cocoa, organic soy milk...  The mix is great without any stories...I can not grind sesame seed in the grinder since it is so oily that ruins the grinder and flax seed is the best balancer for grinding. I grind for one week use and keep it in a sealed container in freezer. Regardless of that, I have to consume both seeds due to the high mineral content which is a necessity for my healthy diet. For years I have been doing blood test and my omega-3 has been much higher than the highest level required for my age, year after year. Although I consume fish, it is the flax seed that pushes my omega-3 higher. I consume the mix first thing in the morning before surfing, mountain biking or weight lifting in the evening.

I kept the bag and found them on Amazon and started buying them by the case. Not as salty as regular chips, they also have considerably less grease, more of a tasty rice cake experience than a greasy Lay's chip. I have bought cases of the single-serve bags, and end up giving them to friends and coworkers, who turn around and order them for themselves. Yeah, they are good.\n",

Compared to other brands of organic green tea, these bags seem to contain about half as much green tea leaves, causing me to use two bags for each cup of tea I brew, otherwise I just end up with a dissatisfying cup of weak tea.  Go to Trader Joe's and get a box of their organic green tea,their tea bags are filled generously, and your tea will be a nice bright green!I'm sure there are other great brands of organic green tea, I just have had great experiences with the Trader Joe's brand. Bigelow brand seems to be trying to make up for the more expensive costs of providing you with organic tea by skimping on the amount in each bag. I really don't blame them though, they gotta keep profit margins up in these tough times.\n",

      "I noticed these treats at the local store and thought the concept sounded delicious - real peanut butter cookie dough covered in chocolate and individually wrapped for a quick treat while on the road or at work.  I thought that the Mrs. Fields name would yield something pretty good for a product such as this. My expectations, unfortunately, were unmet.<br /><br />These cookie dough creations are awful.  Just awful.  When you open the package, there is a faint smell that is chemical peanut butter mixed with cheap chocolate.  Upon the first bite, you realize that the cookie dough is not soft but dry and really doesn't taste like peanut butter.  In a blind tasting, I would never call the flavor peanut butter.  The overall sensation is that this is chemical.  The aftertaste lingers in a very unpleasant way.<br /><br />I award two stars because it is convenient to plop one of these in a purse or lunch bag.  Additionally, if I were in a plane crash (knock on wood), I could eat these but a piece of a passenger seat might easily become more tempting.<br /><br />I purchased a 4.4 oz bag from Meijer for about 2.50.\n",

The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.\n",

They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

      "I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.\n",

      "I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to \"feel\" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />REGARDING THE FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. The Pepper variety is not as versitile; in fact, it is quite spicy. You will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully. However, they can be eaten alone as well, as a light in-between-meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.

In one sense, i thought it was 45 cookies per package, with 3 packages - thus, 45 x 3, but then i again re-read the info, and i gather and the more likely answer is, the total is ONLY 45 cookies!!! Now, this is 'neither good' nor 'bad'. All it is, IS, you are paying pretty much the price that is on  the cookie bag if you were to buy one alone at a supermarket, but having it brought right to your door, thus shipping!  So, you are really paying the SAME PRICE of a GROCERY STORE, and little more, for 'shipping' - but, for me, I have no car, so, to have 3 bags of cookies arrive at my door, while i sit sans car, makes things only a little bit easier.  I still say, it should be 45 cookies PER BAG, with 3 bags in this total, 'special package' deal....  Cause if you think about it, it DID SHOW THE PRICE OF $25 AND UP with a line thru it, thus, implying you were getting over 100 cookies!  Cause why on earth would someone pay, 25$ for the product, alone, then the 7$ shipping on it, if it were only TOTAL 45 cookies?

Now to classify it as Mexican food here in SoCal is going too far, so I don't categorize it, I just like it.<br /><br />I like their sauce and their flavorings, so was eager to try this out.<br /><br />And I like it.<br /><br />It's only slightly hot, which is nice for those of us who like to taste our food rather than experience burning from it.<br /><br />Adds a nice flair to any meal.  Last night I put some on a turkey burger, and it was great!<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is basically a mix of ranch dressing and mild or medium hot sauce, but here are the exact ingredients, if you're interested:<br /><br />soybean oil, water, whey (from milk), vinegar, buttermilk, salt, egg yolks, sugar, spice, tomato, food starch, garlic, garlic juice, onions, xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast extract, phosphoric acid, gum arabic, corn syrup, disodium insinate and disodium guanylate, natural flavor and colors, preservatives.\n",

      "I found the new Crystal Light mocktails at my local grocery store for about three bucks each initially, but now they aren't there any more.  This is the only place I know to get them. Crystal Light's new flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini. I love real Mojitos and Appletinis and I also love Crystal Light (though I had been a bit bored of most of the flavors at this point). The Appletini mix is like drinking Jolly Rancher green apple candy. It has that fake-apple taste and a slight sourness, which is very similar to the less expensive appletini mixes. If you make your own appletinis using things like sour apple pucker, you will likely not appreciate this.  I like it in small doses.  UPDATE: after 3 canisters, I really can't drink this one any more. It's too cloying.  But I still love the mojito!<br /><br />Each canister has 5 packets, and each packet makes two quarts. An 8 ounce glass is 5 calories. Keep in mind that a real appletini (3 to 4 oz) can be about 160 calories.<br /><br />If you want something similar to Appletinis and delightfully different from other Crystal Lights, you'll love this! I have several non-drinking friends who come to our dinner parties (which have lots of alcohol flowing), and this is a great option for them.<br /><br />I like the Mojito and Margarita better though.\n",

It is especially good toward the end of the bottle after it has been exposed to air for a while which seems to mellow the heat and leave behind a nice, distinctive Habanero flavor. Also as mentioned, the green stuff is great, but is hotter still. I like the red stuff on eggs in the morning. Starts the day off with a bang!@ It is much hotter than Frank's Red Hot or El Tapatio, so go easy the first time.\n",

      "The first month I tried this tea I still had pms pains of headaches and bloating and intense cramps during my period.  I was a bit turned off by the taste and smell as well in the beginning.  But I continued to drink it around the next month and noticed my usual pms bloating went down with my food cravings and headaches were non-existent.  I felt like something was \"wrong\"...and questioned myself if I was going to skip my entire period?  Well a couple days before my period I had a lot of twitching feelings in the lower abdomen than I have had in the past but no spotting.  My period was pushed a little further past my regular cycle. On the night I got my period the pain was extremely MILD on/off and only lasted until the next morning instead of the whole day.  I'm on the 3rd day and have absolutely no pain and taken way less ibuprofen than I have in the past.  The second day of my period is usually the most painful and this is a huge change for my menstrual cycle and pms.  Another thing I notice is the blood seems to be flushing out of me faster/more heavily.  Highly recommend.  Worth a try and even if it doesn't work for you it's still good tea.\n",

We traditionally have family pizza night on Sat. and the kids miss it when we travel and camp.  This quick pizza dough is the answer.  Just add water and you're ready to go! We use the Coleman folding oven and our camp stove to cook them.  The dough is very versatile.  We use one package per person and we each add our own favorite toppings.  It's awesome!! Too bad I can't buy them in my own grocery store. I like them so much I order them from Amazon by the case! I use small pizza pans when I cook them, but if you make the crust thick enough you probably wouldn't need a pan. I also have the pizza pan that you can use over a fire, but I haven't tried it with this dough yet.  Anyone else? I made up Pizza making baskets for Christmas presents using this dough and it was a big hit!\n",

She had sores all over her stomach and when it got really bad they would even go up her back and into her ears. She went to the vet multiple times and the best he could do was put her on steroids and antibiotics. They would go away but then come right back. He put her on the Rabbit and Potato prescription dog food. The food helped and cleared her up but its $75 for a 25lb bag!

I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.

I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!\n",

I gave a negative review on Kool-aid's packaging of this product for another flavor, because I felt it was ridiculous, especially since you get two separately packaged boxes of Kool-Aid, which means they could sell them separately, if they chose to. I consider the price and the way a product is sold to be just as important as the product itself, so I'll leave that review there. That being said, I broke down and bought this flavor since I love Mango so much.  You'll love it even more when added to the pina-pinneaple flavor also sold on Amazon. Oh yeah, you'll have to buy 96 packs of those as well. Good luck finding these flavors in your stores.  I have no idea why my three favorite flavors (this one, the lime and the pina-pinneaple) are not to be found anywhere near me.  I live in la and you would think a product called \"Aguas Frescas\" could be found close, no? Anywho, you'll love the flavor and so long as you're willing to drink it for a couple years, it's worth the price.

      "I was never a coffee drinker in the past. The bitter and often foul flavor of ordinary coffee was not to my liking and, other than the often-needed boost from the caffeine, I could see no reason to indulge in something with such a nasty flavor.<br /><br />My opinion changed with the invention of flavored and higher quality coffees and as a result of this change, coffee is part of my regular drinking routine. Starbucks is one of the pioneers in leading these changes and when I heard about this, Starbucks Natural Fushions ground coffee with vanilla flavor, I was anxious to sample. Starbucks makes this product using natural vanilla which, combined with quality coffee, sounded like a successful culinary marriage.<br /><br />So, how does this coffee measure up? Well, it certainly has a very pleasant aroma that whets the appetite and I doubt anyone would dislike this aspect of the product. The problem is, unfortunately, the taste itself. I was expecting something much more vanilla- like in flavor but the flavor is instead a little harsh, roasty, and contains only a touch of vanilla. How Starbucks managed to produce such an aromatic product that tastes so different, I am not sure.<br /><br />However, this isn't to say the product is bad. I find it decent as a general coffee for everyday consumption. I also like that Starbucks encourages recycling by offering a free cup of coffee if consumers bring the empty bag to a nearby Starbucks location. The coffee is responsibly grown and ethically traded, too, as indicated by the Starbucks Shared Planet symbol. However, the bottom- line is taste and based on the lack of real vanilla flavor, like I was expecting, I can give this product only an average rating overall.\n",

He was having problems with lactose-based formulas, and it was crucial that he gain weight, so the doctors in the NICU switched him to Prosobee.  He's nearly 5 months old now and he's almost 15 pounds!  He was 4 lbs. when he was born.  If you want to give your baby soy formula, I would recommend this one.  I tried the Similac version, and it made him very, very gassy.\n",

      "The taste of this tea is absolutely phenomenal. I grew up in southern India(Hyderabad) where tea flows like water and chai wallahs are omnipresent. It was hard for me to appreciate the choices I have in the states as far as tea is concerned (Black tea specifically) because none of the black tea I find here tastes good to me unless I turn it into chai by adding milk and spices. But this tea does not need even a crystal of sugar because the combinations of cinnamon and sweet cloves they use make it naturally sweet and it smells heavenly too. Every time I go back to India, I order a box to take with me.<br /><br />The tea comes in different packages. You can buy the large rectangular bags which come in shiny copper-colored tins which are not value for money compared to these individually wrapped, slightly smaller tea bags. I seep two bags in piping hot water for three minutes to reach the strong taste I like.<br /><br />Keep sipping! :)\n",

      "My dog loves these things and although they are expensive, I feel good knowing that these are a much safer alternative to rawhides.  For those that aren't aware, rawhides do not digest very quickly and can clump inside of a dogs stomach resulting in an expensive visit to the vet. So to get on with the review...<br /><br />The Pros:  They are 100% all natural free-range, grass-fed beef.  They are made with no additives, no chemicals, and free of hormones and antibiotics.  They are human grade processed and USDA approved.  The are fully digestible, low in fat, high in protein and help reduce tartar and keeps your dog's teeth and gums healthy.<br /><br />The Cons:  They smell. They really smell... And they are expensive.  Value Pet Supplies has some of the best pricing I have seen.  I use to buy these things at the specialty pet supply stores (but they sell them for seven to nine bucks a piece) so when I found these on-line for more than half the price, I was ecstatic.  One thing to note.  Shop around at different websites.  The best pricing I have found is to go directly out to either the Value Pet Supplies Website or the Best Bully Sticks Website.\n",

The moment I touch the bag, my two cats and two dogs line up in a row and wait in eager anticipation for treat time. When we are out of them they all just wander around the kitchen scowling at me.  By a long shot, this is everybody's favorite treat.  And I love the fact that there's nothing else in these except chicken.  I know this product is designed to be sprinkled on top of food and when we get down to the bottom of the bag we use them for that, but for small dogs and cats, these make a great treat.  A big dog would probably devour the whole bag in a matter of minutes so I wouldn't bother for big dogs unless you wanted to use them as a training treat.  The chunks are small, but for my chihuahuas and cats they are practically a meal.<br /><br />If they seem pricey for the amount you get, remember that dehydration removes the water and without the water meat weighs about 1/4 of what it weighed when fully hydrated.  These aren't cheap by any measure, but they aren't ridiculously expensive either when you consider that one 4oz bag is made from about a pound of meat and unlike most treats they aren't packed with fillers.\n",

Like the corners were a bit chipped off, maybe from rattling around in these tubs. Really, not a big deal - but the ones that come in the standard packs seem to be glossier and more attractive. Just saying :)\n",

      "My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term \"all about tuna fish\".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.\n",

      "These Nonni's Biscotti \"Toffee Almond\" are good tasting, but very sweet and have 110 calories each. My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite with my wife and teen son when we sit down for coffee or tea, but I prefer the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7YO2M\">Nonni's Biscotti, Originali, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.

      "This is my 3rd Switch review, after trying the Watermelon Strawberry and the Kiwi Berry.  I'm a fan of all of them.  The Black Cherry is the one that tastes most like other \"normal\" sodas, so if you're looking for a taste you recognize, this is it.  The taste is definitely more cherryish than some of the artificial flavored sodas you'll find in supermarkets.  On the whole, it's definitely tasty.<br /><br />As with all the Switch beverages, I find the carbonation to be very pleasant: small bubbles that don't lead to an unpleasant feeling of \"gassiness.\"<br /><br />I'm sure a bunch of other reviews have pointed out that the description of \"just juice and bubbles\" isn't quite correct: it's juice, bubbles, and a whole lot of natural sweeteners.  I'm not ready to have this replace water, milk, or juicy juice on the list of things I'd rather my (future) children drink...  but if it's a choice between this and soda?  This is definitely the lesser evil.  It's nice to have as an alternative.\n",

      "When I selected this, the description at the time did not say it was pods, or I would not have chosen it. I don't have a pod coffee maker (as much as I think they are adorable!)<br /><br />I just started drinking coffee beverages last year, I've always hated the taste of coffee but found I can stand it with cream and some flavored syrup (thanks McDonald's and Starbucks!). Cost being what it is, we started making these drinks at home, with coffee we bought at the store or Sam's. (Folgers and the like) So, since I'm a coffee newbie, I'm not up on all the varieties and tastes and roasts, and just thought that all coffee was the same.<br /><br />I brewed up a small batch of coffee in my pot, using one pod and 2 cups of water. I took a sip of the coffee before putting anything in it and I was shocked that I actually liked the taste of this. Normally coffee is so bitter and strong tasting to me, but this had a sweet floral-tinged taste to it. When I made my usual cream/syrup contribution to it, I found that the background taste was wonderful! It was so smooth and didn't have any kind of bitter aftertaste as I am accustomed to when making coffee.<br /><br />The package is pretty enough that you could give this as a gift to a coffee lover! I would serve this to company and be proud that it tastes better than the Folgers I normally have. This was a nice surprise, and opened up my taste buds to the possibility of better quality coffee than I am used to.\n",

      "If you're trying to avoid sweets over the holidays, but drink coffee and like chocolate, this may be just the thing.  As promised, it is strong and satisfying--so much so that this reviewer, who drinks Starbucks regularly, will be using less that the prescribed amount in the future.  A small cup will have you convinced that you had some imported dark chocolate.  Of course, the coffee does have caffeine, so this can't be a go-to beverage too often during the day.  It appears that a decaf version is available, and that's the one I would keep on hand so as to avoid the fattening snacks which are a constant temptation during the holiday season.<br />$14. a pound is a lot for coffee, so I would consider this a luxury to purchase occasionally or as a gift, or to put on your wish list so you get it as a gift.

The flavor is exactly the same, it dissolves into hot and cold liquids the same.<br /><br />The only difference I can see is the packaging. The regular package is paper, this new package is foil-lined, making it a bit more difficult to shake the contents down, and more difficult to rip open. It's not a huge issue, but I really wish they'd used the regular paper packets instead of these new ones.<br /><br />If I was lacking fiber in my diet, these would be an easy way to add it back. Since I eat a ton of fiber anyway, I probably won't purchase these again. If the packaging and pricing was the same for both, then I'd seriously consider buying these over the regular Splenda, but with the added hassle of the foil-lined pack, I'll stick with the regular Splenda.\n",

      "Blackberry and Pomegranate flavor was already a hit with me. My opinion is exactly the same with Mango Pineapple. Good strong Lipton flavors, very sweet for the sweet tea lovers, but I like mine less so, thus, here's what I do.<br /><br />I must watch my calories, sodium, sugar, and fat due to health issues. Thus tea is a preferred drink over sodas. I want to live, and live a good lifestyle. This product helps. The flavor was fruity, as good as I expected after trying another flavor earlier. I've tried lots of flavored teas from other makers and usually have gone back to regular plain old Lipton. This is different, it's good.<br /><br />IT'S HEALTHY, BUT IT CAN BE MADE EVEN BETTER (IF NEEDED.)<br />FOR 8 OZ (that's half a packet, as the packet makes over 16 oz.) you get ZERO Fat & Sodium. Sugar's only 1g (per 8 oz.), calories only 5. 10mg caffeine if that's an issue for you, not for me.<br />After realizing the drink was a bit sweeter, like southern sweetened tea, and I'm used to less sweet, I tried mixing the drink with an equal amount of club soda. By doing this you cut the nutrituion facts in half (per 8 oz serving). WOW. Even better. Now the bold Lipton Blackberry Pomegranate and or mango Pineapple flavor is still there, but less sweet. I enjoy the drink's fizz from the soda. Remember equal club soda/water mixed with the same amount of Lipton mixed as directed has a serving size (8oz) calorie cut to 2 ½, sugar only 1/2g. The drink came out as clear as sun tea.<br /><br />Kids will love this sweetness. Kids need drinks with low calorie count. That's becoming major for child health.<br /><br />Convenience is a plus, an easily opened individual tube of powder, travel friendly, a freshly mixed drink at work, or make it one bottle at a time at home. No more having several types of bagged tea on the shelf to mix one with another, and then a remaining half-pitcher of tea going funky in the refrigerator. This has a shelf life of well over a year. It is tons better than instant teas I've tried, easier storage than bottled brew, and has the refreshing taste that the world has come to expect from Lipton. My sample convinced me to begin converting from the mess of tea bags.<br />I'm sold, 2 flavor attempts and both very satisfying to me. Now, which flavor should I try next?<br /><br />Dare I mention this can be carried in a shirt pocket or purse to a restaurant and instead of ordering those overpriced drinks, ask for the free iced water, then pour in your Lipton, stir, and \"Bob's your Uncle\".\n",

I've been taking it every day for about a year now(so has my husband) and we have been sleeping better, and I truly do feel a bit more relaxed. I also started taking it in the morning and evening and have noticed I have been having less panic attacks.  I am not saying it \"cured\" them, but I definitely have noticed a difference (for the better) in severity and occurence.  I have not missed a \"dose\" in months.  This stuff rocks!\n",

      "\"The bold citrus taste of glycerin combines with the artificial flavors to create a uniquely disgusting cocktail ingredient.\"<br /><br />Excuse my sarcasm, but this is one of the most disappointing bar purchases I've ever made. Unfortunately, I didn't look at the ingredients until after I purchased the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture. Silly enough, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Fruit Roll Ups: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors.<br /><br />These bitters taste awful. There's a slight grapefruit flavor behind the awful, overpowering lime (as in limestone, not key lime) flavor. If you want grapefruit flavor in your drinks, this isn't the bitters for you. You should really just buy a bag of grapefruits and spritz a small amount of juice into your drink. I've used this in a couple of drinks, and each turned out poorly. I thought it might give my Negroni a nice additional grapefruit boost, but all it did was poison the drink. It tasted chemically and sour. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!\n",

      "I had the opportunity to try out Cafe Escapes' Cafe Mocha k cups when my boyfriend's sister gave us a couple of hers to try.  I was a little wary to begin with because I'd tried the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE\">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> and remained unconvinced that chocolate flavored powders do well in the Keurig brewing system.  But since this was a chance to try a mixture of both chocolate and coffee, I couldn't turn it down.<br /><br />Unfortunately the final result was much like the Swiss Miss... way too fake!  Almost a plastic-like flavor.  Just awful.  The coffee side of the mizture was either too weak or watery because the mocha just tasted like watered down hot chocolate with a (very) little bit of bite to it.  Nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I'm glad I was able to try a sample of these pods rather than spending money on a box only to be disappointed.  I think a great alternative would be to brew a cup of your favorite blend of coffee and then add in a spoonful of your favorite hot chocolate.  A bit more effort, but the payoff will be leaps and bounds better than this one.<br /><br />This k cup is a pass for me.\n",

I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read \"Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!\"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!

      "We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.\n",

I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.\n",

      "As I poured boiling water over the tea bag a subtle scent of magnolia teased my nostrils. \"Teased\" is the operative word: the aroma stimulates the senses, but mostly vanishes when one actually begins to drink the tea; I can't say that I actually tasted it.  This tea is remarkably free of bitterness for a green tea, good for those who want both a pleasant and healthful experience, although I think the health benefits of green tea are overrated. Black tea generally has as high levels of antioxidants as green, cup for cup, but I suspect that the reason green tea is favored by some is that it is lower in caffeine; thus if caffeine gets in your way, you can drink more green tea than black and thus get more antioxidants into your system.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging, each teabag (I like the convenience versus loose tea) is enclosed in its own biodegradable packet and has a tiny slit to help the consumer open it easily. I think the box, which is rather close in size to roughly similar items on the grocery shelves (Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow teas, etc.), is a little large to contain only 16 tea bags.\n",

      "These are natural, healthy, freeze dried treats that are about the size of a half dollar and a half-inch thick. They're a little too big to fit in a Kong or the rubber mesh ball I put treats in for my dog so I give her these treats as a reward. The texture is just what you'd expect from something that is freeze-dried and they're quite crumbly so they will make a mess on the floor. Fortunately, my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb. Obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn't picky so I would be shocked if she didn't like these. I would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  I usually pay for treats. I most often get the Mother Nature biscuits made by Natura. I gave these treats four stars due to the price and the size being too big. The ingredients are as follows: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.\n",

      "My husband and I tried this tea because it was on sale locally (4.99 for 80 ct. bag) and it surprised us by becoming the TOP favorite for us both. It is rich like an Assam, malty, comforting with sugar and a dash of Half & Half for me, plain or with a little sugar for my hubby. I would have to say it is by far the smoothest yet heartiest cup of tea that we've ever enjoyed, and when the coffee runs out for my First Cup O'The Day, I'm switching to this tea for the gentler eye-opener.<br />Plus, the frugal gourmet within knows it's cheaper than coffee even if you use the bag once only. Hubby has a 2-cupper size mug and gets 2 quite hearty cups from 1 bag.<br />It is a bit odd to me to rave over a tea, but this is how I feel about it. If I opened a real tea room (instead of just a virtual one as I have now,) this tea would be the House's \"Signature\" Cup. It is impossible (given the time) to drink only one cup and not have an immediate refill. A perfect autumn-winter tea especially, with a nice round flavor that can stand up to spices and/or alcohol. In fact, I just talked myself into another cup right now. Cheers!\n",

      "I need to make this bread without eggs or milk.  Using water, egg replacer, and following the directions, the bread it OK.  It is sour and doesn't have much taste.  I experimented.  I now use twice as much vinegar, twice as much honey, natural almond milk in place of the water, and I brush the surface of the dough, once it has risen, with virgin olive oil.  The result is magnificent!  It makes a creamy, very white loaf with a nice crust.  The look and feel of the cut bread is just like... bread!  Yay!  The sliced bread holds up to sandwich dressings and fillings.  It is very important to follow the instructions to let the bread cool completely, then slice it and freeze the slices.  I wrap each slice in waxed paper, then put them in a freezer bag.  If you don't want a toasted sandwich, just take the slices out of the freezer and leave them on the kitchen counter, at room temperature, for 20 minutes or so, and you have fresh bread.  You can also put the frozen slices in the toaster if you are in a hurry. This product is a big success!  Just to be complete, I use a Sante cast iron loaf pan, and I find 40 minutes at 375 degrees is just perfect.  Good luck!\n",

      "Like many others have said, if you have a local Kirkland, it's probably best to get this coffee locally and save yourself $10-$15. I got this for about $13 and it's worth every single penny. I have a real love for Colombian coffee and prior to this, I was drinking Yuban. Well, Yuban was very good when I first tried it. I'm not sure what happened but now their coffee just has a different taste and not for the best I might add.<br /><br />When I learned that Costco has their own branding of coffee, I just knew it would be both cheap and big in quantity as well. But would the quality hold up? Well, being how I enjoyed many other Kirkland products, I can safely say that this Colombian coffee is a worthy addition to that list. Being how it's virtually impossible for someone to describe just how a coffee tastes, you'll just have to try a sample for yourself and see if its to your liking. Personally, I still think Yuban is the best when I have first began drinking it a couple of years ago but Kirkland's Colombian coffee definitely is very good as well. It's really hard to beat the price and quantity. This can is huge! Being how its grounded very finely, it should make for good espresso shots. I brew this using a Melitta filter and the coffee comes out just as delicious.\n",

      "the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying.\n",

      "My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be \"sugar free\", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need \"special\" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for \"special\" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.\n",

Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.\n",

However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.\n",

      "I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"\n",

      "I noticed that several reviewers compared this to green teas.  This is actually not a green tea; it is a blend of green tea and black tea.  I found it to be more characteristic of black tea, albeit with a soft, flowery aroma and suggestions of fruit and vanilla in the flavor that I think reflected the addition of the green tea (green and black teas are not different kinds; it just depends on how they are processed).<br /><br />I'm not quite a tea snob, but I probably come pretty close.  I drink tea every day, both iced and hot, and have for most of my life (my parents never thought children should have coffee, but we often drank tea).  I'm careful about how I steep my tea and use water of different temperatures and different brewing times for different teas, depending on their requirements for optimal flavor.  I have definite tea preferences, although they are wide ranging, and I buy many high-end teas (although good old Red Rose finds its way into my iced tea regularly).<br /><br />I found this a very pleasurable, very drinkable tea.  I brewed it with just-boiling water, as I would a black tea, but steeped it for only about 3 minutes (note that I like my tea dark).  It put me in mind of a darjeeling but was more complex and, I think, benefited from the smoothing influence of the green tea.  The earthiness that is claimed to be typical of Puerh tea was definitely present, but very mellow.<br /><br />This is my first experience with Puerh tea, so I did a little reading on it.  It really does have a long history and is one of the first Chinese teas; tea trees known to be more than 1000 years old are still growing and producing tea.  Puerh tea comes from the Yunnan province, one of the most ideal tea growing regions in the world.  It's reputed to dispel the effects of alcohol, help digestion, refresh the mind, and lower cholesterol and triglycerides (wow, what's not to like!)<br /><br />I don't know if it really does have greater health benefits than other teas, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to add it to my tea lineup, and I believe it will continue to hold a place there.  Actually, writing this review has made me want to drink it again, so I think I'll go brew a pot!\n",

      "My French teacher (native French) introduced these cookies to me. I tried to bake these at home following a reliable recipe but it just didn't taste/feel the same. As a healthy eater, I usually don't consume much butter. But the \"petit beurre\" biscuits are now my favorite companion for tea or coffee. They are not heavy or too sweet--just perfect in its texture, taste, and design. I just received a box of 6 just 2 days after ordering (go Amazon prime!) and couldn't help but enjoy two biscuits right away--yum! Probably going to order more once these are gone.\n",

These are like Pringles or Munchos in that they take mashed potato product (in this case, sweet potato), and form them into shapes and bake (excuse me, \"pop\") them.  I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked. Most of the good nutritional value of the Sweet Potato has been lost, I would imagine.  Still, a tastey treat that is certainly not terribly bad for you!  :)\n",

      "The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of \"there must be something better\".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per \"serving\"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word \"puff\" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed \"all natural\". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.\n",

Of course I'd love to have it all the time now, but it's really not that great for you. I mean, it's literally pure sugar! And food dye. So, I just had to get some cotton candy matcha! The idea of cotton candy that is actually good for you, how can I turn that down?<br /><br />The taste of this is SO good. I can't believe it tastes so much like cotton candy! If you told me my glass had melted cotton candy in it with some matcha, I'd believe you because it is that good. AND with no sugar at all! Just water and matcha. And the taste lingers, my mouth was all cotton candy-y for a good half hour after I finished. This is just... it's so good.

Great for emergency snack to at 190 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).<br /><br />These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.<br /><br />Great taste. I love chocolate but these are not overly chocolate flavored.<br /><br />GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!<br /><br />Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 8 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 12 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium.  Protein 4 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 3 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.<br /><br />Crunchy: These are a messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.<br /><br />For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!<br /><br />I have had these for about a month now and I have just ordered the variety pack and the cinnamon flavor pack from amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy, I do.\n",

      "Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone.\n",

      "I like almost everything about these treats (I got the chicken).  They're small (though I still cut them in half when I'm not feeling lazy), perfect size for a quick training treat so that your dog can be rewarded but his attention stays on you (rather than on eating the treat).<br /><br />I like the texture.  They are moist but not wet so there is no sticky residue.<br /><br />The price is good.<br /><br />The ingredients are ok.  Not great, despite the \"natural\" claim, but I don't necessarily expect treats to be healthy.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but, they stink to high heaven.  In fact, they stink so bad that I have to hold my breath whenever I open the bag, otherwise I will truly gag.  I can't describe the smell but despite the \"natural\" ingredients, they smell nothing like what you would find in nature.  These treats have been so highly processed that the original ingredients are beyond recognition.<br /><br />Actually, the smell reminds me of kibble.  I haven't fed my dogs kibble in over a decade, but whenever we dogsit and I get a whiff of our friends' dogs' kibble, I want to gag too.  But the smell of Zuke's is at least 6 times stronger.  I hate how the odor lingers on my fingers after I've handled the treats.<br /><br />In fact, for a couple of days, while working at my desk, I would get a strong whiff of what smelled like crab.  I had eaten a whole crab a couple of weeks ago and kept smelling my clothes, thinking that the crab smell hadn't washed out.  But my clothes smelled clean.  It wasn't until a couple of days later that I discovered the origin of that crabby smell.  It was coming from a treat pouch I had put the Zuke's in and had left on the far corner of my desk about 4 feet away.  If laundering doesn't remove that smell, I'm going to have to toss that pouch.<br /><br />I feed raw green tripe to my dogs on a regular basis, and while some have likened the smell of that to sewage, I don't actually find the odor too offensive.  Certainly isn't pretty but not enough to make me want to vomit.  Zuke's actually makes me want to do that.  It's unfortunate that they stink so much to me, because I would buy more otherwise.  However, I will say that the 1 possible benefit of their intense odor is that it does get the dogs' attention and they don't seem to mind it.<br /><br />But I guess I'll go back to making my own treats.  Chicken/turkey heart or liver, cut up into pieces, then boiled.  Pat dry, then stick in oven on low until dehydrated.  Dogs love them just as much, and not only are they TRULY natural, they are human-grade, minimally processed, and actually healthy.  The things I do for my dogs.\n",

      "We picked up one of these bones at a local pet store last week. Our dog picked it out herself; I held out two different shaped bones for her to sniff to see if she had a preference, and she actually grabbed this one's package out of my hand. She's never shown that much interest in something in the distracting environment of a store, so it came home with us. For two days, it was her constant companion, she absolutely LOVED this bone. She'd grab the whole thing around the middle and chew it on her back teeth with her head tilted back, so that she was chewing the red part more than the nubs. This might account for it's early demise... at the end of the second day I found it on her dog bed in three pieces, including one that was just the right size for an intestinal obstruction, and I quietly made it disappear while she wasn't watching. She's still looking for it two days later, sadly, and I thought about trying another one in the largest size available, but I don't think I want to risk it. We got the wolf-size the first time, and our dog is a 48 lb. Boykin Spaniel/Pit Bull mix. She is is a pretty serious chewer - she's the only dog I've ever had chew a Nylabone Galileo down to a nub that had to be thrown away and replaced - so this might not be a problem for most dogs.\n",

      "This review is of Walkers Shortbread Rounds (1.2-Ounce), 2-Count Cookies (Pack of 24).<br /><br />As every seasoned dieter knows, getting the weight off is only half the battle. Keeping it off requires equal diligentness.<br /><br />For those mid-afternoon sweet snack cravings, granola bars became a staple around our house. One package of two bars of the peanut butter variety comes in at 180 calories. With all the different flavors available, and the low cost, they have proven to be indispensable to managing my weight. That said, granola did become a bit tiresome over time.<br /><br />Over the holidays, a package arrived that included some of these individually packaged Walkers Shortbread Rounds (cookies). Reviewing the calories, I was surprised to see that, calorie wise, they run the same as granola bars.<br /><br />The calories run the same, but the cookies provide a totally different mouth feel and a butter flavor rush that cannot be beat. The individual packs keep me on track with portion control, thank goodness, because I could probably eat ten to fifteen of these little pallet pleaser's in one sitting.<br /><br />Cost wise, granola bars are the winner, but I have found substituting these shortbread cookies a couple of times a week mixes things up just enough to not grow tired of either.<br /><br />When these last holidays passed, I found it necessary to go back into full fledged dieting mode for a few weeks. While whipping up a batch of lemon flavored fat and sugar free pudding one day, I was getting ready to pour it into individual cups and remembered the shortbread cookies. I split two packs between four cups, placing one cookie at the bottom of each, and the poured in the pudding.<br /><br />Yes, adding one shortbread round to each serving increases the calorie count by ninety, but the cookie addition on the bottom acts as a crust, resulting in something very similar to a much higher calorie count cream pie! Delicious, luscious and filling, I used different flavors of pudding to create a variety of lower calorie cream mini-pies. The non-dieters in the house enjoyed them immensely too and none were the wiser that they were eating diet desserts a couple of times a week.<br /><br />Dieting or not, the cookies taste fabulous. Yes, you could do some major damage if you just let yourself go and dove into a box, so moderation is key. For those, like me, that sometimes find moderation challenging, go for the individually wrapped option to help maintain a sense of decorum.\n",

      "First, I'd like to say I'm a soda enthusiast,and enjoy a variety of brands - store brand regular brand. It's not that I can't tell the difference. I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.\n",

Their teeth are very cramped and they are more prone to having tartar build up. I give my dog's a veggiedent daily and they have not needed a teeth clening yet. Their vet has been amazed at how healthy their teeth are. Most small breed dogs need a teeth cleaning by the time they are one years old. I prefer theese over the regular C.E.T. treats, my dog's have an easier eating the veggiedents and they seem to like these better.

I do however like citrus and was in the mood for a lighter tea so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I really like Lady Grey! It is wonderful hot and quite refreshing when chilled, especially on hot summer days. If you find the bergamot in Earl Grey overwhelming you might want to try this one. It also has bergamot but it is much more subtle. Twinings considers Lady Grey to be a light tea, and I can drink it in the evenings without it interfering in any way with my ability to sleep. I prefer all teas black and unsweetened and this has a slightly sweet taste as is.<br /><br />I drink a *lot* of tea and I make sure this one is always on hand; it has a unique taste that I enjoy very much.

      "...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.<br /><br />However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).<br /><br />O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says \"O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.\"  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.<br /><br />Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try.\n",

      "Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.\n",

I emailed them and was told a replacement box was on its way.  Waited over a week and still no replacement.  Emailed them again and inquired as to status and wanted a response....where is replacement and finally if not sent give me a refund.  Finally after no response, Amazon refunded my money.  I usually buy my licorice pipes locally but decided to order thru this company due to it's good rating.  However, I would not recommend them after my experience -- two weeks to not receive my licorice and then have to go buy it locally anyway.  Next time I will save myself the inconvenience and frustration and just go buy it locally....at least I know it will be fresh and not a stale, hard handy that has been sitting on a shelf for who knows how long, plus poor customer service.

      "One out of one owner-and-buyer-of-dog-treats thought they were not worth the cost.<br /><br />A few additional thoughts:<br /><br />I cannot see an \"item count\" on the package.  In the picture, the treats look like skinny pencils.  In fact, each treat is the size of four skinny pencils, with eight in the bag.<br /><br />\"Cinnamon spice\" is a people-flavor.  \"Rancid road kill\" is a dog flavor.  \"rancid road kill\" does not sell well.  That said, buy treats for your dogs, if that's who will be eating them, not yourself.<br /><br />My larger dogs (70#, excellent teeth, and 30#, bad teeth) inhaled these chews, taking just a little longer than they would take to eat fresh meat.  For this price, chews have to last a bit longer.<br /><br />I do not understand how the chews could be considered \"hard\" if used straight from the package.  YMMV.  My Chihuahua took two days to eat his.  He left a mess.  The bigger dogs didn't.<br /><br />My larger, 55# and underweight, young girl dog would not touch these chews on two different days.  She is one of the last dogs on the planet who needs either low fat or low calorie treats, so perhaps she was using good doggie judgement in not wasting chewing-effort-calories on a treat that may have a negative caloric payoff.\n",

With all that's in it, this is a very good value. Considering you can pay as much for any one of the ingredients in it. My personal use is to add this to kombucha, maximizing it's longevity that way, I've tried many but this one is the best for kombucha. They say an 8oz glass has 2 servings of fruit on the Lakewood website. It's quite tasty in that it's not too sweet, very thick textured even with the tiny bits of seed in it reminiscent of a banana smoothie. The ingredient list is somewhat confusing but note that only the Acerola Cherry is from concentrate, everything else is fresh pressed. Acai is very high on the ORAC scale of anti-oxidants, Rose Hips are also very high, everything else is in the mid to high range of fruit. Pomegranate has many beneficial properties beyond just anti-oxidants as well, it's a noteworthy fighter of heart disease and Alzheimer's type dementia. Considering the price of Goji berries I really like their inclusion in this drink, albeit at a lesser level.<br /><br />BTW: Amazon had only 1 day wait before shipping.\n",

The flavor has remained the same over that time and I must say it is delicious and refreshing.  I primarily drink BTFP on days when I don't have time to make a protein shake or when I'm on the road.  If you're shopping around for a great tasting caffeinated whey protein drink, then BTFP is worth your investment (it is, after all, an \"investment\" in your health).\n",

I believe the actual quality of the coffee is acceptable, not great, and not bad. The description does not specify the blend to region or location. However this is most assuredly a Arabican blend.<br /><br />As I stated, this is a matter of individual taste. Personally I detest Arabica blends. They leave a strange earthy aftertaste that stays with you for hours. Had I known this was Arabica derived, I would not have purchased it. That information is entirely missing from the product description.<br /><br />From the quality and freshness of this blend (taste aside) I will not be purchasing any further Melitta coffees from this bagged collection.

      "We have a 8 pound Maltese that is five years old and he will only eat BENEFUL. It is healthy and does not contain ingredients that add to weight gain, yet it provides the protein which helps toy dogs with loss of blood sugar. I have tried all brands of dog food and found that Beneful is his favorite for the last three years. I do not use canned type dog food because it bothers his digestive system. Beneful does not cause his stomach any problems. Toy dogs tend to be very picky with their food and luckily I found a dry dog food he will eat.<br /><br />Whatever your dog's size or breed, I am sure it will love Beneful. I realize that it is more expensive than most dry dog food, but I feel it is worth it for a healthy diet. My Maltese will eat about one cup a day, so a bag last a long time. We live in a rural community and it is hard to find within a range of twenty miles and I'm glad to see Amazon finally sells it. The subscribe and save program ships monthy, with free shipping and NO TAX. Thank you Amazon and Beneful!\n",

It's much more reasonably priced than some other brands of flavored liquid stevia  (which, granted, I haven't tried but they seem to cost twice and three times as much and I seriously doubt they could taste that much better) If you use too much of it it will have a kind of bite to it but that's true of ALL types and brands of stevia. It's just the nature of the sweetener.  I wouldn't call it a \"chemical\" taste though, it's more like a bitter plant taste but it's only if you use too much.  It also tends to get lost in hot drinks.  I dont drink coffee but have made hot cocoa with it and ended up adding too much to get it to stand out and the bitterness came through.  HOWEVER we made the most delicious ice cream with it using 10-15 drops per cup (half vanilla, half chocolate).  You can't even tell it's not regular ice cream.  I highly recommend stevia.  It's natural and you dont have to worry about all the scary aspartame stuff which true or not is still kinda creepy and I'd rather not take the risk.  But I particularly like this brand for it's great price.\n",

In addition, even when the fruity taste is mostly gone, there is no weird or bitter taste either.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm not sure if vitamin b6 and b12 in this gum actually does anything, but for those who swear by these 2 vitamins for energy boost, they can't hurt.\n",

The fruit is considered inedible, however the oil extracted from the skin has been the foundation of the cologne industry for many, many years. Higgins & Burke Earl Grey is provided in individual, foil-wrapped tea bags. Open a pouch and you are immediately aware of the distinct aroma of bergamot.<br />Higgins & Burke chose asian black tea as the base for their Earl Grey.

      "Amazon sent me an entire case of Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry, so I decided to pass it out to my co-workers and elicit their opinions as well.<br /><br />It is nice to see a readily available product made with all natural flavors and no refined sugar. It tastes good and would make a nice addition to a picnic or lunch outside, providing a nice, mellow drink to go along with a sandwich or salad.<br /><br />I was honestly expecting, and hoping for, more of a punch of blackberry soda. It tastes a little like a blackberry tea, a little light in flavor. But the flavor is nice.<br /><br />It also bothers me a little that an all natural soda would be 'fortified'. Yes, with vitamins, but if something is going to be all natural, leave it alone and don't add things you wouldn't normally find there.<br /><br />I first became aware of the Izze brand through their bottled soft drinks, which I believe are also all natural and use no refined sugar. The difference between those and these new cans seems to be the size and the addition of the vitamins. Other than that, I think it is probably the same product.<br /><br />My co-workers seemed to like the taste, but I got the sense they weren't blown away. I don't think this would convert Coke or Pepsi drinkers.<br /><br />I would buy it again, because it provides a nice, lighter alternative to something like Coke or Pepsi.\n",

      "I like this sauce.  It has just the right spice not to give me heartburn.  Additionally, it goes just well flavoring a burger or on top that good chief salad.  The creamy dressing (less sauce than dressing) gives a zip to a plain salad.  Indeed, I love a nice cottage cheese, tomato, over a bed of lettuce salad.  This adds a nice zing to it.  My teen age son thought it added a lot to his tomato and lettuce cheese burger.  Weirdly, he said this sauce is less hot than the mustard he usually uses.<br /><br />Normally, I would give this a five star ranking.  But it's very high calorie.  Two tablespoons are nearly 110 calories!  Wow, that's a little higher than I like.  That is almost the same calories as 100% olive oil.  \"Lite\" this isn't.<br /><br />Still, it's mildly hot, good tasting, and goes well with most salads.\n",

      "All kidding aside this is a wonderful salt with not quite as sharp or metallic aftertaste as most. It still contains the natural minerals and other than packaging has not gone through the usual bleaching, breakdowns, and processing most others do. I really can taste the essence and all the properties when I use it on less complex culinary preparations as in a poached egg, plain baked Idaho potato, rice, buckwheat, or roasted fowl. You get the idea. If you look carefully you will actually see tiny colored trace elements of rock or mineral. One of my favorite finishing table salts. Save the processed iodized salt with the sharp sometimes bitter aftertaste for your ice ridden sidewalks during winter or lay it down around your vegetable garden to get rid of those pesky snails! A little to pricey for brining or cooking with a lot of other components, herbs, spices, etc, etc, so I use my kosher Morton's for that and use this only for finishing flavor enhancements. Love the Amazon Prime as well as you know how expensive some of these sellers shipping and handling can get.\n",

This one is the saltiest of all, is quite watery (and as it is not a dry mix, there is no way to make it less watery). Of the three, this is the worst. The Lime black bean one from this same company has the salt separate in a 'flavor packet' and is a dry mix. You can avoid the salt by not using the full packet, and you can use less water to make it less watery. This has far far more salt that either of the others, and you are mostly buying water. I do not recommend this variety at all. If you want one, try one of the same company that has the flavor packet and is a dry mix. Summary: You are buying a lot of salty water and not much nutrition.\n",

      "My husband I recently ate at an outside cafe in Geneva, IL.  It was late afternoon so we just wanted something light to eat with a glass of wine.  We ordered a cheese plate that include a choice of three cheese.  One of the choices on the menu was a blue cheese listed as \"Pointed Reyes Original Farmstead Blue\".  It was exceptionally good completly outshining the sharp cheedar and the mild Wisconsin Gouda. So much so that I asked to take a copy of the menu home so I could order the cheese on the internet.  Not as easy as I thought, but I did find it on Amazon and ordered it, after I corrected the spelling to \"Point\" Reyes rather than \"Pointed\" Reyes Blue Cheese.<br />  It was delievered in a couple of days intact and as delicious as I remembered. This really is a standout blue cheese especially if you like a tangy sharp blue cheese.  It is creamy but not overpowering and does not have the musky taste that some blue cheeses do. The only downside was the cost of shipping.  The cheese was $18.00 for a pound but the shipping was unexpectely high at $26.00.  The combined cost makes for a very expensive cheese.  I'm sure I will enjoying eating this blue cheese and make certain that I perserve every valuble bite of it until it is gone.\n",

But while I have at least enjoyed, even loved other coffee varieties in the Tassimo machine, I hated the Gevalia Morning Roast so much I threw the rest away after making several attempts to tolerate it.  It was terribly weak, almost chemical-tasting; it tastes like what comes out of a traditional drip coffee maker if you forget to replace the used grounds with fresh ones.  (For the record, my favorites are the Starbucks House Blend and Colombian; Seattle's Best Henry's Blend is milder, less flavorful than those but still a decent cup of coffee, and cheaper than the Starbucks; Starbucks Verona is too strong for my taste.)\n",

      "I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.\n",

In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that \"double spice\" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust.\n",

If you're looking for an alternative to potato chips and greasy stuff that's bad for you, these will do the trick. I'm trying to cut all saturated fat from my diet so having something like this to snack on or to throw a bag in my lunch is going to be great. Great flavor and texture.  Sure they aren't as filling as regular chips but that's kind of the point, right? A full bag should do the trick - it certainly did for me.\n",

      "Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.\n",

      "Like many, I have drank tea for many years, decades, actually, and have had the opportunity to sample everything from the standard bagged teas available everywhere to some of the most expensive hand-made teas developed in Europe using traditional processes. I won't try to pretend this St Dalfour tea is the equivalent of these highly esoteric (and incredibly expensive) teas, but what I can say is that this is a truly great tea for the bagged varieties, and, due to its unfamiliarity, would certainly qualify as a \"sleeper\" find. I can recommend this particular brand and variety as one of the best I've had.<br /><br />What makes this so good? First, the ingredients are all natural, with no artificial flavors or fillers (check your labels carefully and be surprised to see how many flavored teas rely on artificial flavors). To take it a step further, the ingredients here are all organic (see the information on the boxes and on the website to read about this), with no pesticides, artificial colors, or flavors added. At first blush, one might not be immediately attracted to a \"black cherry\" tea, but the manner in which St Dalfour blends this results in a flavorful tea that contains a subtle flavoring and aroma of black cherry that is really wonderful.<br /><br />If you prepare the tea correctly, you'll end up with a very smooth and delightfully flavored tea that may become your favorite. One secret for this, or any, tea is to not steep the tea more than 60-90 seconds MAX, and then remove the bag. It might seem like too short of a time at first, but if you force yourself to keep to this time, with a few dunks at the end, you should begin to see how tea can really taste if it isn't over-steeped and allowed to turn bitter. (Everyone has a strength preference and so you'll have to experiment at first, but if you can keep it to no longer than 90 seconds, that should be ideal.) Further, if you have a water boiler that allows you to select temperature, if you use a water temperature right below the boiling point, that smoothness can be extended further.<br /><br />An easy recommend to the tea lover, this tea is one of my favorites. Five stars.\n",

I dislike giving negative reviews but I must to save other customers from perhaps making the same mistake.  The product is very sweet and has an unusual taste unlike that of homemade Rice Milk.  Why must the product contain so many ingredients? I will ask Amazon to approve a return of the product, or give it away.  Be careful about ordering this product.<br /><br />Paul Rowell\n",

This is definitely one of the better wheat free gluten free boxed dinners out there, and I actually look forward to eating it. It is a little too salty in my opinion, but I don't season the chicken or veggies I add, and that seems to cut the salt a bit. It is definitely quick and easy, and tasty, too. I will buy again!\n",

      "I buy a big tub of these for my dog about every 3-4 months. He loves them. I do mix them in with other treats, so he does not get a steady diet of them. They are given out as the \"special\" treat, being one notch above a standard, wheat-free dog cookie.<br /><br />While these are great treats, they are not as \"hypnotic\" as real meat is. And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush. My dog's interest in them after they get wet goes down a lot.<br /><br />I do wish the pieces were more uniformly sized, but they aren't too hard to break apart.\n",

So she's on a hypoallergenic prescription venison diet, and all things like rawhide and her regular treats are gone.<br />For treats I give her fresh vegetables (no protein) now.<br /><br />She so sadly missed chewing, so I searched high and low for something she COULD have.  The completely inedible chews were of no interest to her and the things she wanted weren't allowed.<br /><br />This was a good compromise.  She's definitely interested in it and wags her tail for it and chews it, but she doesn't make much progress.  The bones basically just get that gnawed-on look.  Anything she's swallowing is too little to harm her.<br /><br />I'm really happy and this will be the only bone she has for the rest of her life.

The Aztecs called this \"the food of the Gods\" and it truly is...incredibly healthy and full of vitamins, protein, antioxidants and it's extremely filling. I have gotten many people hooked on it using it as a substitute for rice.  I got these chips (multigrain and the cheddar flavors) simply because I saw good ol' quinoa in the ingredient list but also tons of other good stuff: Stone Ground Yellow Corn, Non-hydrogenated Canola Oil, Brown Rice Flour, Flax Seeds, Turbinado Cane Sugar, Oat Fiber, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Quinoa, Soy Flour, Sea Salt, real cheese in the cheddar.<br /><br />But having \"good\" ingredients doesn't often equate to good taste.<br /><br />It does here.

A rarity for a snack.  Bring on the cheddar and I'll sign up for auto delivery.

      "The fact that this is made with cane sugar actually has very little to do with how good it tastes, or how much it tastes like Coca Cola. If you find it is a touch sweet, you can a. try using a little less syrup! And honestly, I suggest that you try this anyway because the cap this bottle comes with is huge. Or, b. try using more CO2 when you are carbonating your water. If neither of these suit you then c. doing both should help a lot.<br /><br />I like this flavour a lot. If you really want the closest thing to Coca Cola, this is as close as you will get without spending more for a huge cannister of actual Coca Cola syrup, the kind sold to stores and restaurants. For the price, I think most people will find this more suitable.<br /><br />As a final note I will say that although I love this flavour, I tend to prefer the other Cola syrup, the one that comes in a white bottle--even if only for its lower price. The breakdown to take away from these two types of soda (because I know this is why you are here), this Cola syrup tastes like Coca Cola, and the white (cheaper) bottle tastes almost exactly like RC Cola.\n",

So that makes this sweetener \"100% Natural,\" as emblazoned on the box.  The problem is, I detect a distinctly chemical aftertaste.  It could be the molasses, but it tastes more chemical than molasses to me.<br /><br />I am not such a purist about my artificial sweeteners.  But I do expect them to taste like sugar - and one would think, with sugar being the second ingredient, this one would have an advantage.  Not so.  (Don't get me started on the \"Made from Monk Fruit\" labeling.  When it is the 3rd of 4 ingredients?  And what does a monk fruit look like anyway?  Or taste like?  Does it taste like Nectresse?)<br /><br />My favorite sweetener is Splenda Essentials with B vitamins.  Nectresse is also made by Splenda.  It has a sugarlike consistency and dissolves easily in my coffee.  However, as artificial sweeteners go, it is my least favorite.  I might actually forego sweetener if this were the only one available.\n",

I opened this bag first, knowing I wouldn't like it; why not get it over with quickly, right?<br /><br />I was totally wrong. The aroma is amazing right out of the bag, especially the raspberry. So far I've ground it for drip and espresso. The drip brew was smooth and tasty, but the chocolate and raspberry don't come through very much in the flavor (I use cream and sugar) - that may be a good thing for some people. Using the espresso grind in an aeropress was AMAZING. The chocolate and raspberry came through in both scent and flavor, and with the natural sweetness of the coffee bean I didn't add any sugar at all, only cream. Will be trying it in a french press next.<br /><br />I only opened the bag two days ago... and I'm snacking on the coffee beans! I don't DO that! I think chocolate covered beans are gross. But once or twice a day I find myself opening the bag and stealing off with three or four beans.<br /><br />Is this my favorite coffee? No. Would I buy it again? Absolutely.\n",

      "As the popularity of the Senseo pod system wanes and that of the Keurig system grows, there is diminished availability of pods that fit the Senseo. The Senseo brand pods are available on Amazon at a decent price. Unfortunately, the Senseo pods are not as good as competing brands formerly available on Amazon such as Fratello, Halo, Millstone, etc. Of the Senseo pods, the French Roast has a richer flavor than most of the others. It is often on sale and is a bargain when that happens. I suspect that the Keurig system makes good coffee, but I cannot imagine paying so much for a Keurig pod (thimble).\n",

      "These Clusters remind me a lot of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P4H57Q\">Cracker Jacks</a>. Do they still make them? Obviously they do, since I have found a link to them in Amazon groceries. The Clusters do not come with a toy inside or with peanuts, but they do come in nice crunchy bite size clumps, except maybe for the unclumped bits, which appear to be sinking to the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />I have been eating them out of the bag, which has a built in seal strip.  They are not too sweet, having only a few grams of sugar per serving of 29 grams, i.e. around one ounce. The ingredients are nothing scary, just the usual unusual grains: amaranth, flax, millet, and quinoa.  How did they miss my favorite, spelt?<br /><br />These are good tasting, and presumably good for you. What could be better?\n",

I cannot notice any differences of it helping me.  It is a nice taste though.  Difficult to describe.<br /><br />There is no caffeine so it won't wake you up or keep you up.<br /><br />The bottle states it is \"doctor recommended\" and it goes into no further details about the doctor (specialist, retired doctor, what country the doctor is in, etc.).  Or why he/she recommends it.<br /><br />It is a high bottle, and most likely you will need to  keep it on the door as it's too high for most shelves.  But it's a good size bottle so that if you are thirsty, you won't need to refill.<br /><br />I'm taking one star away from it as there is little details about the water other than it basically stating \"a doctor recommends you drink this 9.5 pH  water.\"  No web link or telephone number for details.<br /><br />But as I said, the water does have a \"heavy taste\" (to me) and I found it to be a good taste.\n",

      "I remember growing up in Brooklyn in the late 70's, happy and carefree--a perfect childhood in every way but one: my parents would not let me or my brother eat Kellogg's Apple Jacks.<br /><br />Saturday mornings were the happiest times for me any my brother. We woke early, rushed down to the living room to watch cartoons, and munched on our favorite cereals--but never Apple Jacks. Every time that commercial came on with its snappy, rhythmic jingle, my brother and I would sing along:<br /><br />\"A is for apple,<br /><br />J is for jacks--<br /><br />cinnamon, toasty Apple Jacks.<br /><br />You need a good breakfast,<br /><br />that's a fact.<br /><br />Start it out with Apple Jacks!<br /><br />Apple Jacks! Apple Jacks!<br /><br />10 vitamins and minerals,<br /><br />that's what it packs!<br /><br />Apple-y, tasty, crunchy, too<br /><br />Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!\"<br /><br />And always on those final words, \"Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!\" my brother and I would punch each other in the face and fall down on the floor, laughing our heads off.<br /><br />We begged our parents for Apple Jacks, but they never got them for us. We ate a bowl once, at a friend's house, and got so pumped up and full of apple-y goodness that we not only punched each other in the face, but we also punched our friend's mother in the face as well. She told our mother, and from then on, we were never again allowed to eat Apple Jacks.<br /><br />It's been a long time since then and I'd forgotten all about Apple Jacks until I saw an Apple Jacks commercial one day while my kids were watching cartoons. Suddenly the memory of my childhood hit me like a ton of bricks and I immediately put my mother in an old-folks home and then went out and bought some Apple Jacks. As soon as I paid for them I ripped open the box and began munching down great big handfuls of Apple Jacks in the supermarket. Some pimply-faced bagger mumbled something about not being allowed to eat in the store, but I punched him in the face and laughed. I was filled with apple-y goodness!<br /><br />Imagine my overflowing joy, then, when I found I could get an entire case of Apple Jacks, packaged into convenient, ready-to-eat individual cups, shipped right to my door! Now Apple Jacks are the only thing I eat, and even my pee smells like Apple Jacks! I called my brother, and he also got a case. We also put our father in a nursing home, but not the same one as our mother's.\n",

      "We have tried many brands of coffee this year and found most to be rather disappointing. Not so with the Community brand coffees we've tried so far. We've like them all and have enjoyed the Cafe Special the most. We're going to stick with this one.<br />The Cafe Special is a clean, medium roast with almost undetectable acidity.<br />For the best tasting brew, start the brewing process just long enough to dampen the grounds and then let them sit and bloom for a minute before restarting the brewing process. You'll have brewed a grand pot of delicious, aromatic coffee.<br /><br />I have 2 bags at a time delivered - Keep one at home and I transfer the contents of the other bag to a container that seals tightly and take it to work with me so I can make coffee just for myself. - The rest of our work crew either doesn't drink coffee or are content with the awful, vile smelling and tasting (in my opinion)generic, canned coffee our company supplies each branch office. I keep my very own 4 cup coffee pot in my personal office and brew my excellent Community coffee there. - Usually 2 pots a day. Sometimes I even share a cup or two or three with coworkers when we're all stuck working late. How nice of me!! :)<br />Everyone comments how the coffee in my office always tastes so good. Can't figure how they can go back to drinking the icky, free stuff.<br /><br />The price is right for this coffee too and having it delivered via auto ship makes it even better.\n",

The texture was too solid, not at all melty, zero creaminess, and the chocolate itself had an odd off flavor that took me a while to figure out - it was acidic, very much so. This is chocolate in its most natural, healthy, and sadly, least tasty form.  If you are eating this for health purposes, it's the right one, but there are a thousand better tasting chocolates out there.  It's a shame since I really wanted to like this, but those European confectioners that have been tweaking chocolate for the last couple of hundred years, they knew what they were doing.\n",

      "I have been on a long quest for \"nutrition bars\" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: \"dates, almonds, and cherries\". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: \"Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut\". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: \"Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves\". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk.\n",

      "I've tried the NOW Foods organic walnuts before. These regular walnuts however are not as fresh as the organic ones I purchased. In one bag, I came across about 5-6 rancid ones, but compared to a bunch of other brands I've purchased, NOW Foods walnuts are still a bit crisper, lighter, and fresher tasting, regardless.<br /><br />That being said, I want to remind shoppers that you can purchase at Trader Joe's a 16-oz bag of walnuts for $7-$8. Whereas NOW Foods (at this time, they are being sold for $27 for 3 packs, $9 per pack) is only 12 ounces for $9. I've tried both, and in terms of freshness, they are roughly the same, but NOW Foods walnuts are noticeably a bit larger. But when it comes down to it, it's really about the amount you're consuming -the weight, and not size. And you can get way more for less if you go with TJ's. Unless, you're using these walnuts for some kind of fancy display or something on a cake, or for guests. But, I've never seen anyone make a cake with whole walnuts smothered all over it or use a walnut as a centerpiece.<br /><br />BUT, if you plan on buying the NOW Foods Organic line of walnuts, which run for about $10-$11 per pack on Amazon, they are more worth the cost since they are noticeably fresher and overall richer in taste compared to this bulk package of regular walnuts. I've never found a rancid nut in NOW Food's organic walnuts. So, in summary, you're better off with a one pound bag of TJ walnuts or, if you're willing to pay an extra buck (or $3-$6, if you buy 3 packs of the organic ones), for the NOW Foods Organic walnuts.\n",

      "I love dark chocolates, the darker the better. However unlike the many other Ghirardelli dark chocolates this one isn't good.<br /><br />The chocolate itself doesn't melt smooth, has bad mouth feel, and is absolutely flavorless. The chocolate actually reminds me of the poor tasting choco-bits in some ice creams, just waxy and lacking of flavor. And it doesn't even taste the same as their regular 60% chocolate. If Ghirardelli would have used the same chocolate as their other filled delights then it would actually taste really good.<br /><br />The caramel filling is the only redeeming quality of the chocolate. Smooth, full flavored, and not overly sticky (like some chocolate makers tend to use).<br /><br />Overall this is a poor quality chocolate that is waxy and flavorless with the only good thing being the caramel filling. Ghirardelli really dropped the ball on this one and am a bit surprised that they allowed it out on the market.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy a different flavor or brand, this is definitely not Ghirardelli at their best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Caramel filling tastes great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waxy, doesn't melt well.<br />The chocolate itself is flavorless.\n",

It's a step up, health wise, for him, as this drink is 100% juice and offers vitamin C.<br /><br />We thought it was just the right sweet - but we are a family that likes our sweets.  The strawberry flavor was more pronounced than the watermelon in this drink, but it was a good blend.  I'd say it is about as sweet as Juicy Juice, to give you an idea.<br /><br />It was very fizzy, offering a pop drinker that just right 'burn'. I can especially seeing this being a drink to grab before bed, as it gives the soda pop satisfaction, but has no caffeine. It's a bit pricey, but I'll be looking for specials on this for sure.<br /><br />I'd be careful giving it to a child that was overweight though.  It is pretty high in calories and could contribute to a weight problem.  My son is so active, he needs the calories.\n",

      "My mouth is in heaven.  I am always searching for a healthy snack bar that doesn't have too many calories, inulin or sugar alcohol. I want something with ingredients I can read that has a good amount of protein and fiber balanced against low carb and fat.  This bar meets all the criteria.  You get 5 grams of fiber from the peanuts and agave fiber and 7 grams of protein.  The fats are a little on the high side (12 grams) but that's coming from the peanuts.  I love that the peanut butter used in the bars has just one ingredient - peanuts.  You get a total of 18g of carbs with 9 of those coming from sugars.<br /><br />I received my bars on one of the hottest days of the summer (108 degrees F) and my bars were warm and gooey.  I suggest a quick trip to the fridge if it's hot outside because the bar was too sticky to get out of the wrapper.  The stickiness and warmth didn't affect the flavor however.  It was a perfect balance of saltiness with a slight sweetness from the molasses and raisins.  The peanuts gave a little crunch so it wasn't all gooey.  This is a snack bar that will go on my shopping list from now on.  With 200 calories per bar, it will make a filling afternoon pick me up or go with a salad or soup for lunch.  For the vegetarians out there - these bars are vegan.\n",

      "Pepsi original<br /><br />Pepsi is an amazing soda! The taste is like Coca Cola, but theres a diffrence.<br />  To be on the right page, it was the first caffeine soda I ever had. At first I didn't know if I would like it. Then the first drink hit me. I had never ever tried something like it. At last I had my first caffeine soda. For a month the only caffeine soda I had was pepsi.<br />  My parents decided I needed to try something new! So my mom went shopping. Instead of bringing home pepsi she brought home Dr. Pepper. They told me I needed to try something new.<br />  The very first drink of Dr. Pepper I didn't like. I'm not saying Dr. Pepper is nasty, I'm just not into it. Later on in the month my mom went back to get pepsi. I was so happy I did a happy dance. I love the colors of the pepsi brand! They are red, white and blue. Just like the colors of the flag.<br />  9 out of 10 of my friends like pepsi. They have some problems and so do I.<br />  The taste, well lets put it that you can't really tell someone the taste. It's just difficult to describe the taste. You would take a sip and if someone asked what it taste like you wouldn't be able to tell them.<br />  Now this is the important part! If you like Dr. Pepper then you won't like pepsi, but if you like Coca Cola then you will like pepsi! I want everyone to try it. It's an enjoyable drink and I hope you think so too!\n",

      "Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label \"yeast extract\".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.\n",

I was suppose to pay $7.49 for shipping and the product cost was $5.71 which would be a total of $12.00 and it was to be delivered in two days, it came like four days after.

      "This reminds me of Summertime in my childhood when my mother would bring a ice-tinkling pitcher of Kool-Aid out to the backyard, and serve it to us while we sat splashing in the wading pool!  So, I was very pleased that Amazon offers this, since it is getting harder and harder to find in the Seattle area. I do most of my grocery shopping on-line at Safeway, and they don't offer it or any Suger-Free Kool-Aid flavors. I think the price is a little high, but I ordered it on sale and also subscribed to have it delivered bi-monthly, so the price is more reasonable. I also purchased the grape flavor, but Tropical Punch is still my favorite. Next time I will get the Cherry flavor, because I like it mixed with Crystal Lite lemonade! It disolves very well in cold water, and to me does not taste sugar-free at all.  And of course it is even more refreshing and delicious served up in my vintage 1960's Kool-Aid pitcher and little Kool-Aid cup!!!\n",

      "Bleech.<br /><br />That's how I'd describe this coffee.  To be fair, I'm one of those purists that grind their own beans and shy away from artificial flavors.  However, I'm open minded and gave this a try.  For a treat sometimes, a flavored coffee can curb some of those urges for a sugary treat.<br /><br />Opening the back I was instantly hit with the smell.  Strong and overpowering.  The smell wasn't of coffee, it was of some air freshener you'd find in a gas station checkout.  I still decided to brew it though, so I could be fair in the review.<br /><br />I tried it via standard drip brew, toddy, aeropress and french press.  No matter what I tried, the brew came out overly bitter.  This is partially due to the extremely fine grind.  When I tried it with creamer and/or sweetener, the brew was more tolerable.  I was still tasting the artificial flavor more than coffee accents.<br /><br />If you generally like the swill most companies server in their breakrooms, then this is definitely a step up.  For those of us with a bit more refined coffee palate, take a pass on this and add your own Torani syrups to achieve the hazelnut and vanilla flavoring.\n",

      "I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?\n",

I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.\n",

      "My two maltese really like these treats. I like the Extra Fresh flavor much better. Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents have gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given these mini ones, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers- I now give them the medium version after some trial and error, as these mini ones were devoured too quickly. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other, harder dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. These treats smell pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay nutritionally for a treat, and the chewing action is always a good thing, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other flavor, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are really pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.\n",

      "The first thing I loved about this coffee was how quickly it was shipped and I loved the different type K-Cup. While I realize that some people were upset because it wasn't like the regular K-Cups...I actually like this style better. This style is more compact and much easier to store, once I opened one of the 3 bags, I just placed the open bag in a zip lock storage bag to maintain freshness. I hate bitter, strong, dark coffee and that is always my biggest fear when ordering an unknown. In my search for something that appeals to me I have found many that were too strong or too weak. At first taste, I thought OMG..this is the one!! Not too weak, not too strong and I could actually taste a nice flavor but about half way through the cup, I started to notice an aftertaste. So, while I won't have any problems drinking what I bought, I probably won't buy it again even though the price was awesome. I'll keep my fingers crossed that once I get used to it, I won't notice the aftertaste\n",

I personally am not big on the greasiness that most potato chips have, so I actually prefer a baked chip like this.  I also like that these chips have a little less salt than most chips, so the potato flavor really comes through.<br /><br />Let's face it:  a potato chip is never going to be a truly healthy snack.  Even without the extra fat that comes from frying and without the excess salt, a chip is still a bunch of simple carbohydrates.  If you can control yourself and not scarf down bags at a time, however, this is a reasonable indulgence to add to your diet on occasion.\n",

      "I ordered two of these bones for my two pitbull mixes. Both of the bones together, shipped, on amazon cost what one of them was in the pet store. These bones hold up well to my strong chewers and they're only able to get little shaving pieces off at a time. To the people who have trouble with these bones because their dogs ate them, These bones are NOT edible! It states it directly on the package. If your dog swallows large pieces of things or chews large pieces off these are NOT for your dog. ALWAYS supervise your animals when they are chewing on toys. All in all these bones are great for my two big mushball pitters. :)\n",

It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.\n",

      "My four year old beagle loves the tug a jug! It was recommended by the shelter I adopted her from, and it keeps her busy. I give hre about a third of her meal in her bowl, and the rest in the tug a jug.  It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high-value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.<br /><br />There are two down sides - one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything! Definitely recommend. However, I will saw that these products are significantly more expensive at Petsmart/Petco - I recommend Target, Amazon, or a local shelter's shop where the proceeds go back to animals in need.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

      "I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.\n",

      "Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.\n",

Frankly, it was on par with the water that I pour out of my Brita Filter. It was palatable chilled and also made a nice cup of coffee.  Although the large size is nice to have on hand, I found the bottle unwieldy for anything other than in hyouse, in refrigerator use.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits claimed, I cannot confirm  that the ph is 9.5.

That being said, after having a long day and needing a little pick-me-up late at night and fearing the late-night caffeine insomnia, I broke down and tried the half-caff. I was and still am very pleased with the flavor and level of caffeine of this product even though I typically prefer a stronger brew.  It has a typical medium roast flavor that is uneventful and can appeal to most coffee drinkers that are not too picky in their tastes.  There is very little aftertaste and I have not had any issues going to sleep after drinking this beverage later at night as I have had with other blends.\n",

Sodium - 190mg (8% of DV) per 2 Tbsp serving with roughly 8 servings per pouch.  Yikes!<br /><br />Besides the overwhelming saltiness, the flavor is pretty good.  Not too spicy, but there is a little kick.  I would try this again, but I would probably use half the sauce and try to dilute it with something else.  Maybe a salsa verde from a jar?

There's just a little puffed rice in there too, which I also think adds an nice additional texture. But what I like best about these is that when you're eating one you know you're eating a date and walnut bar. There's not such a high proportion of any of the other ingredients that you feel like they begin to compete with the two main ingredients, they simply complement them very well. I try to keep one in my purse for emergencies (although I could happily eat one even if it wasn't an emergency). And finally, they're gluten free which some of my friends appreciate.\n",

No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.\n",

The specific gravity of the grape juice was right at 1.075, which is the low end of the specification range (1.075-1.090). I added sugar to bring it up to 1.085 before starting the fermentation.

There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.\n",

They are free of dairy, gluten, meat, soy, etc and are raw, so almosy anyone can eat them.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor analysis. The first flavor I tried was Key Lime Pie. It was really, really good. Next I tried Cherry Pie. It wasn't as good, but with its strong flavor I found it to be the perfect companion to a few pieces of dark chocolate. When I had women over (I'm a young single bachelor) I'd share with them some dark chocolate and a cherry pie larabar and they would almost get as much enjoyment from that as they did from me. I just opened my new box of Lemon and it is easily my favorite flavor so far. Incredible, I don't want to risk trying another flavor because lemon is so good. My roommate preferred the lime but says the lemon is his second best.<br /><br />So to recap: these are good, buy them.\n",

You can make a good egg cream with just about any chocolate syrup, but if you want it to taste like the ones you get at a soda fountain \"this\" is the syrup you need.  And it's sooooo easy to make.

About 98% of the time, this is the case for me however, with PepPod this is NOT the case.<br /><br />PepPod comes in a tablet form and dissolves in your cup of water. The directions on the packaging give you an option to tailor your flavor from strong to strongest. Strong is 16oz of water, Stronger is 8oz and Strongest is 8oz of water. None of this is listed on the online description. According to the reviews and the product description PepPod is not like any other energy drink. You get a burst of energy naturally; no jitters, jittery feeling, racing heartbeats, and a crash after it wear off. It also has 81mg of caffeine and says on the packaging that if you are \"sensitive\" to caffeine maybe you should consult with your physician.<br /><br />I made sure to try it when I was tired. I was on my way to my part-time job after already working an 8-hour day and took mine in 10oz to be on the safe side. I was so excited because I have been trying to find something like PepPod. About 30 mins after drinking my PepPod I started feeling sick, nausea, jittery feelings and even more tired than I did before I drink it. I am NOT a caffeine drinker. I do not drink coffee or soda but I wouldn't consider myself sensitive to Caffeine as I have in the past but maybe I am now because I do not drink it now and haven't in years. What I do know is this product made me sick, it was ineffective, and everything it claimed to do it did NOT! To the caffeine drinkers maybe the 81 MG and the other ingredients will not affect you. To the non-caffeine drinkers this will certainly affect you and 81 mg of caffeine is equivalent to a cup of coffee. I will NOT recommend this product to anyone I will be returning it.\n",

Everything has to be accounted for, each field has to be clean of other grain, each machine used has to be used only for GF oats, it's a daunting task to take on! So, thank you Legacy Valley and the other few hard working producers!<br /><br />I would have given five stars except these oats tend to come with too many husks and unrolled oats in the bag. If you don't carefully sift through them before cooking, you'll be pulling the hard husks and unrolled oat pieces out of your cookies or oatmeal bowl.

Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.\n",

      "I buy these lollipops for my kids, and they really like them, especially the grape and strawberry. I actually like these better than regular lollipops, since the fruit flavors are real - they don't have that \"chemical\" taste. Some of my kids are sensitive to artificial colors and flavors, so it's great to have these for holidays and occasional treats for the family.<br /><br />As others have noted, the distribution of flavors tends to be uneven, but since they are all good, this hasn't been a serious issue to us.<br /><br />The colors are bright and pretty, but they are not the neon colors you see with artificially-colored candies. The watermelon is a pretty light pink, the grape is purple, the cherry and strawberry are darker pinks, etc. If you're used to artificially-colored candies, the biggest surprise will be the sour apple, which is yellow.  Some flavors are two-toned; the mango is especially striking, part clear orange and part opaque light yellow.<br /><br />Of course, organic candy is always more expensive than the artificially-flavored stuff, but this large package is pretty cost-effective.  With the subscribe & save discount, these lollipops currently cost about a dime each, which I think is a good deal.\n",

I bought 48 of these thinking it was 'donut house' coffee.  Well, it is.  But what I didn't realize is that Donut House is apparently a brand, not a flavor.  The good news is that this flavored coffee doesn't completely suck.  Don't get me wrong, if you like 'Donut House' regular coffee, you probably won't like this flavor.  I don't.  But it's not their fault that I buy things on amazon without reading the fine print (or in this case, reading the primary description).  I will suffer through 'chocolate glazed donut' for the next 3-4 weeks so that I might learn this lesson:  Read the description of what you are buying!

      "I fed this, for the longest time (almost a year, cycling with \"Wetlands\" variety) to my English Bull pup. She appeared to enjoy it, presumably because it's a very rich food - multiple high-lean protein sources, unique protein, good fat content, grain free and at the low end of the premium food price line ($48 / 30 lbs @ my local shops).<br /><br />She grew quickly, her coat is always shiny and smooth, her eyes bright, incredible energy for an Eng-Bull and she never had any bathrooming or vomiting issues. Stellar grub for her.<br /><br />Now to the unless:<br /><br />I still give this food 5-stars because my scenario is comparitively unique. I'd gotten a 2nd pup (Treeing Tennessee Brindle - like a Plott Hound, only smaller). Immediately began transitioning her from her crap-food (Purina Puppy Chow) to ToTW. She liked ToTW as much as my Eng-Bull but about the 3 week mark began developing a bad case of Pyoderma (puss filled sores, akin to hives) on her belly, neck and where her joints meet the body. My first suspect as it should be with anybody was a protein - what does ToTW Praire and Wetlands have in common? Chicken and egg product.<br /><br />Thus began the transition to \"Pac. Stream\" who's sole source of protein is fish meal... guess what - the pyoderma worsened. Her belly was redder than a fire-hydrant, countless numbers of pustules, balding from all the itching she was going through and incredibly destructive behavior (I have a 16 item list of all the stuff she's eaten - includes digging a hole in the couch, a cell phone, dozens of poo-bags - in my absence and I'm pretty sure it wasn't due to separation anxiety).<br /><br />Next step, check ingredients and what do ToTW \"Prarie\", \"Wetlands\" and \"Pac. Stream\" ALL have - that's right: Fish meal. Now, between Cefpodoxime (a wide spectrum antibiotic), some strong prescription shampoo and the removal of all fish proteins from her diet she's looking good and behaving better.<br /><br />Thus, this is a great dog food..... unless you've got a pup w/ fish allergies (you could still reasonably feed the \"Sierra\" blend but none of the other three).<br /><br />As a side-note, if you do have a pup w/ what you expect to be food allergies try Natural Balance LID (Limited Ingredient Diet) blends. Both of mine now eat NB LID Venision / Sweet Potato w/ canned supplements that don't have any fish protein or oils in them (Merrick has a great line of canned food sans fish product).<br /><br />- MD.\n",

Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant.

I don't like overly sweet cereals, and Quaker's Oatmeal Squares fit my taste perfectly.  My kids, who typically do like sweet cereals, even liked Quaker Oatmeal Squares.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this cereal is the way it made me feel full in a lasting way so I didn't eat too much of it, or snack on other things between breakfast and lunch.  This was quite helpful in my dietary goals.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Squares come in four flavors, all of which are good.

      "Planters Big Nut Bars are quite tasty. The mix combo of nuts in a big bar size makes for a delicious treat. It's a nice balance blend of nuts in a tasty triple nut granola bar.<br /><br />My husband, who is a big peanut fan, really enjoyed the Big Nut Bars. In fact, he ate the whole box and left me only one to sample for this review. (How nice of him, huh?) He was the one who told me that as a peanut bar, the Big Nut Bar is terrible(not enough peanuts), but as a granola bar they're awesome! (I laughed when he told me, but when I tasted the bar I discovered he was right.)<br /><br />Me, I'm not so fond of peanuts and generally avoid peanut products. (And I married a peanut nut, go figure.) But I liked the Planter's Big Nut bars. The peanut flavor was not overpowering which allowed me to enjoy the other nuts as well. If my husband left me a couple of more bars, I would've gladly snacked on them.<br /><br />Planters Big Nut Bars are delicious and worth trying.

      "This product was very easy to prepare.  One warning to those unfamiliar with GF 'dough'...it's more like a very thick muffin batter.<br /><br />While wheat flour has that stretchiness, this does not, simply because it's gluten-free.  I think if I had been more prepared for the consistency, it wouldn't have seemed so odd.<br /><br />That said, it was easy to mix (I did it by hand) and it did rise a bit during the waiting period.<br /><br />I added dried oregano and chopped fresh garlic to mine, and will add more seasonings next time I make it.<br /><br />Spreading the \"batter\" is not hard, if you are prepared.  I used a cookie sheet and made one rectangular pizza from one package.  Make sure you oil/spray the pan and you will need to spread the mixture using wet hands.  Again, since this is not wheat, you will be doing more spreading and patting down than stretching.<br /><br />You bake the crust first and then add toppings. I used jarred spag sauce, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions and shredded mozz cheese.  Baked it for about 18 minutes and it was perfect.<br /><br />This will not fool anyone into thinking this is a traditional wheat pizza dough.  There is no comparison, as wheat has totally different characteristics than these ingredients.  BUT, this product is great.  Really, it does not have much of any taste at all, and you can add whatever herbs and spices you want to the mixture to customize it.  The texture was slightly crunchy and even my husband loved it.<br /><br />Since this is my first GF mix, I have no other point of reference, so I can't give it 5 stars.  BUT, I will continue to use this product on a regular basis and I'm looking forward to trying the all-purpose flour I ordered at the same time.\n",

      "I am a working mom and often feel like I don't get enough rest.  I depend on my caffeine fix to get me through my daily grind. I came across this product when a friend recommended it.  At first I was sceptical, because I hadn't heard of the product before, but I decided it was at least worth giving a try.  WOW, that's all I can say.  This product might not taste best in water, but in my orange juice I can't even taste the sweetener they add.  I found out that the ultimate results I got from taking it, whether mixing it in water or my juice, was the same... it gave me a great boost of energy.  I didn't feel jitters and it kept me going for hours.  In fact, I now use it at the start of my day and then later in the day before heading to the gym after getting the kids fed for dinner. This product is really convenient and I can even take it with me to work and take it whenever I want.  I did receive an insert with my order that suggested I cut the ends to get the product out best.  I would definitely suggest doing this as well.  I tried tearing it myself on one of the packets and it was difficult to get the contents out. I wrote to customer service and they told me that this has been addressed with their future batches.  But for now, that's the only negative... have scissors close by!  Overall though, I would highly recommend this product.  It works awesome and I never felt this from some of the other energy drinks out there.  I don't like most of the carbonated ones in the stores and the 5 hour upsets my stomach.  The price seems fair too, but maybe they can offer free shipping in the future for larger orders!  Just a suggestion from a happy and loyal customer! :)\n",

      "First off, I greatly enjoy these salsas as my everyday salsas, especially for cooking.  We have a store in the local Cleveland area that sells them for $3.29 a jar (as of Oct. 22, 2011) ... previously they held at $2.99 for the longest time (years).  The hot is not overly hot, and the medium fits the bill for family recipes.  The green is equally enjoyable.  The mild, while good just doesn't have the bite I look for in salsa however, I could understand many friends would find this their favorite.<br /><br />Now, my bone of contention is with the price listed here (and elsewhere on the web) for sale - $14 for a jar of processed salsa.  Even local producers who produce a fresh product max out at $6/16 oz.  For $14, I would say run away fast ... it's good stuff, however no way is it worth $14/jar.\n",

I ordered it last weekend and the plant arrived within a few days.  It is bigger than expected and even had a couple \"babies\" attached.  The plant is now proudly displayed at my sister's house.  Great experience!  Would purchase from this vendor again.\n",

It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, \"ok, it's just too thick\". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!\n",

      "My daughter was on Good Start Gentle before finally moving to Similac Alimentum when her milk protein allergy was diagnosed. After 6 months of spending $500+ on formula, we were given the go ahead to try Good Start again. She struggled with the taste (Alimentum tastes AWFUL and Gerber Good Start is sweet in comparison) at first, but we tried switching her again by giving Good Start as the first bottle of the day and she had no problems. She's been on it for 6 weeks now and has no more gas or fussiness than she did on Alimentum. We love Gerber Good Start!<br /><br />When she was on Good Start Gentle previously, we used the 8.45 oz cans or the quart-size cans. Neither of those can be found anywhere. The new packing is great and weighs a lot less. I buy it as Babies R Us or Target - they always seem to have some in stock, even if it's only the 4-packs ($6.29 at Target!). The 24 pack cases seem to run about $39.99 when they are in stock. Babies R Us has had two specials in a row on them (buy 2, get $10 off instantly; then buy 2, get $15 off instantly), which they honor on multiple purchases in one visit. They also do rainchecks if it's not in stock.<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon will get some more in stock soon - we go through 4 cases a month!\n",

Common terms used by my taste testing group included: light, hints of citrus, crisp, acidic, and brisk.  One close friend admired the clean taste and commented on how well this would go with a cheesecake or similar heavy dessert.  I couldn't agree more.  The pods worked perfectly in our office's Senseo machine, and we all enjoyed the chat and the coffee.  For the price listed, most of my friends, and I, agree this is well worth the cost.

They aren't totally solid, but their baked quality gives them a harder consistency that provides a great crunch for dogs.  The closes thing I can compare them to are small croutons, (these are slightly smaller) like you'd put on a salad for instance.<br /><br />I make sure I've got a good supply of them around the house.  For the money, that hasn't been a problem.  And with the wholesome ingredients they contain, you don't feel guilty about giving out a few extras ;)\n",

Well, caffeine is caffeine and this guy is a bit strong for me.  I prefer Caribou's breakfast blend over this Green Mountain version. It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.  I think this one tastes a bit burnt, like Starbuck's, not at all as nice as some of their other blends (especially the pumpkin spice - awesome!).  Try it to see if it suits your taste but get the 12-pack first.  Otherwise, if you think the way I do, 24 of these guys is a LOT of coffee to wash down!\n",

      "As I said above, I LOVE this stuff. Yeah all capitals on love ;). I have been eating this product for almost a year now, and while I started with the regular peanut butter flavor, I tried the chocolate soon after and never looked back. I use this every morning in my homemade oatmeal. I use instant Quaker multigrain oats about 50 grams(much heartier & filling than regular quick oats), along with some dark brown sugar 6 grams, a sprinkle of Butter Buds season salt, a serving of Chocolate PB2, some kosher salt to taste don't know how much & about 11-12 grams of Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate chips (they're dark chocolate chips). Overall when I use 50g of instant oats,  it is about 295 calories according to My Fitness Pal calorie counting app on my phone. Using the serving size of 40g is about 262 calories. 40g is 1 serving according to the container I believe but I like just a little more.  I got the idea when I purchased the Quaker instant oatmeal in Chocolate Chip flavor for my kids. I was starting a diet and was eating as healthy as possible, and I thought hey, I can make this but in a healthier form. I have since been eating this and an apple daily for breakfast for about 9 months now and it's the only thing I look forward to eating every morning. That's amazing since I usually get sick of eating the same thing after awhile and need a break. Sometimes I never even crave that particular food again if I've really overeaten on it. I now often eat it as part of my dinner as well since I crave it so often. It's almost like a dessert when I use semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips. I have also used different types of chocolate chips (semi sweet, milk chocolate, Hershey's special dark choc, etc.) but usually go back to using the Ghirardelli due to the so called health benefits of eating small amounts of dark chocolate that is made of at least 60% cacoa. I have maintained my goal weight for the past 9 months and have not gained additional weight eating this, so for me it is not only healthy, but a somewhat guilt free indulgence at times when my body craves a sweet dessert. All good things in moderation though, if I ate this in larger quantities or more often in the day the carbs and sugar Would catch up to me and I would start to gain weight again, so just like everything else you need to be conscious of calories in and calories out if you want to add this to a healthy diet. Love it!!!\n",

Mono fats like olive and coconut are healthier fats than even sunflower, vegetable, and canola oils, however olive oil doesn't tolerate the higher heats for frying/pan frying and some people don't like the way it tastes in baked goods.  Coconut oil doesn't contribute to slowing of the thyroid like vegetable oils can and tolerates the higher heats of frying that olive oils can't.  It imparts a light tasty coconutty flavor to baked goods.  I just wish it came in more user friendly packaging.  Convenient 1/2 cup portions within a larger container for instance would be great.\n",

It does, but unfortunately, it also includes some non-desirables. For me, Sucralose is an unproven benefit and I generally avoid it if possible.<br /><br />It is too bad Lipton adds it to this tea. It over-sweetens the tea and adds the undesirable ingredient. I am used to the slightly bitter green tea taste and think covering it up takes away from the overall appeal. I would prefer a little more honey instead, but even then, I think unsweetened green tea is sellable as is. The mango flavor is about right, while I did not detect much, if any, pineapple flavor.<br /><br />Half a sachet is sufficient flavoring for a pint of water.

So far my favorite has been the buckwheat & millet granola by Emco that I found at Grocery Outlet one time but I can't seem to find out where to purchase it. My second favorite so far has been the Kind Vanilla Blueberry flavored granola. It is crunchy, which is a must for me. It has some clusters but not many. It has a good flavor and doesn't taste burnt like the Bakery on Main Fiber Power Cinnamon and Raisin Granola I tried. Overall, this is good granola as the flavor is good and the texture is right. It is also a healthier granola. There are two reasons why this granola is only 4 stars instead of 5: 1) Price - I can really only afford to be spending $3.50/12 oz bag for granola, times are hard and gluten free food in general is not cheap; 2) Clusters - there just aren't enough clusters, which are my favorite part of granola, to satisfy me.\n",

      "is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.\n",

I decided to buy these at Amazon.com because they are such a better price than I could find them in stores. An added bonus was that Stacy's brand is our favorite in terms of taste (compared to Trader Joe's and other store brands) but they are normally more expensive per bag, so it was nice to find them on sale.  However, I will note that I bought these as part of a promo (one of those save $$ off a purchase) so I don't know if they will be as good of a deal in the future.<br /><br />The only downside of ordering these (and other items from Amazon grocery) is that since they come in bulk, you end up with a lot of the product at a time.

I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)\n",

      "The product is a \"granola bar\" looking silver foil packet containing nine individually wrapped candy lozenges.  Each lozenge contains 20 calories of \"sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, and butter\" (actually labelled that way, in that order, on the wrapper).  The product is actually manufactured in Italy by the G. B. Ambrosoli Ronago company, and imported by Andre Prost, Inc. of Old Saybrook, Connecticut.  The label goes on to say that \"Honees\" is a registered trademark of Andre Prost, Inc.<br /><br />At a time when people all across America are spending $ billions on little tiny bottles of caffeine marked \"one hour energy,\" it appears that the Prost company is trying to cash in on the \"energy\" fad with a more honest approach that simply provides a blast of sugar. They have added vitamins B6, B12, and C to the product, so that three lozenges contains 100% of the daily requirement of these vitamins.<br /><br />Its very pleasant tasting.  Its got a nice mild \"honey-ish\" flavor, and the liquid honey center is a very nice reward at the end.  And I'm a person who enjoys the taste of honey and its benefits for a sore throat who is also aware of its high caloric density.  I was surprised that its only listed as the fourth most common ingredient; perhaps because honey is so much more expensive than sugar.<br /><br />For someone who normally enjoys hard candy (I'm not - my dentist advises against it.), \"Honees Energy Plus\" might be a nice addition to the product choices.  When I ordered the product, I was expecting a granola bar type experience, not a hard candy.  I suppose they are hoping people will overlook the calories to focus on the vitamins and energy.  Its a worthy idea.  Yet the candy, energy, and throat lozenge categories are all busting with product entries and are very competitive.\n",

      "If you like Blueberries (and who doesn't), but don't have time to go pick them, this is the product for you. The blueberries are dried and taste better than fresh blueberries. I usually have to add sugar to fresh blueberries because they aren't very sweet naturally. These dried blueberries have a little corn syrup added already, so that makes them extra tasty. These are whole blueberries, not pieces of blueberries like some other brands. So, that's good. I put them in my oatmeal every morning, which is delicious. You could also put them in pancakes or muffins or even just eat them out of the bag. Blueberries are full of antioxidants which is good for your health. I don't know who picks these, but I'm glad I don't have to. I picked blueberries once and it took forever to pick just one pint. Plus it was hot.

Sometimes it would take 2-3 months unless you were willing to pat $250 a box.  Now they've fixed the inventory issues but have totally screwed up the packaging.  Where they used to just place a cardboard strip in the middle of the treat, now they shrink-wrap it in very tough plastic.  You have to fight with it for 5 minutes just to get the darned thing unwrapped.  And they've gone backwards environmentally speaking.  All of the packaging used to be recyclable but now it goes in a landfill.  I've just had it.  My puppy prefers your chews, but I think it's going to be Best Bully Sticks from now on.\n",

It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all.\n",

      "I am used to artificial sweeteners, although I have and do use regular sugar. That makes it surprising that this sweetener struck out so badly with me. It is far too sweet for me. I thought of all things, it would go well with a bowl of oatmeal, not so! It just tasted kind of strange.<br /><br />This sweetener is not really for diabetics. It has both sugar and molasses in it, although low enough to slip under the amount to trigger sugar carbs on the label.<br /><br />To my taste, this is super sweet stuff, and I do not care for this particular combination of sweeteners. This is my subjective opinion, and someone else's could be entirely different.\n",

The physical fatigue is still there but that is something I just have to pace myself with.  This \"Energy Shot\" is NOT loaded with caffeine and uppers.

      "I found this cocoa at Whole Foods and thought it was expensive, but I splurged and bought it. I had never heard of cocoa with pieces of dark chocolate in it. I like to make mine with whole milk or 2%. I do have to add sugar because it is too bitter for me without. Having to add sugar doesn't bother me much because I keep lots of different sugars in the pantry and I like being able to customize a little. Sometimes I use a dark muscavado sugar or coconut palm sugar. I do have to keep stirring my cocoa before I drink it because if not the dark chocolate bits drift to the bottom of my cup. Then I end up with chocolate sludge when I am done. Another reviewer mentioned heating the milk appropriately solves that problem. However I am not sure I want those tasty bits melted completely as I like the bursts of bitter chocolate they add to the my sweet cocoa.<br /><br />I should say that my roommate also loves this cocoa and would rate it 5 stars too, but she is not the review writing type. She also like her coffee without sugar and prefers this cocoa without sugar too. She prefers to use fat free or 1% milk.<br /><br />I later found it a couple bucks cheaper at Sprouts and even cheaper yet on Amazon if I am willing to buy 3. I can't help but wonder if regular cocoa powder and a little shaved dark chocolate might perform the same though. It would be loads cheaper too.\n",

      "10/08/12 Update: Someone pointed out that the Anise also comes in these little beveled squares. I much prefer that shape. They are like lovely little red jewels going in the mouth and the taste and feel on the tongue is smoother with no sharp corners. The beveled squares last longer. When it comes to the jagged little chips I can't resist chomping them. - Not so good for the teeth.<br />-------------------------<br />Claeys can always be counted on for great hard candies and this one is no different. The candies are kind of a red, a littler harder than some of the other candies, and comes in little chips rather than drop form.<br /><br />The only reason for not giving it high marks is that the Anise flavor is light and delicate and I prefer a much stronger taste. However, the fact that the taste is not overpowering makes it great for guests. Even people who don't normally care for Anise have said they like these little beauties.<br /><br />This is good stuff, just mild for my taste.\n",

It has a subtle berry flavor (but not a mock flavor one you get tired of), nice walnut pieces, and very balanced in the sweet/tart factor. It feels very hearty, balanced and filling, on top of being delicious. Does not feel bland or overly sugary. I love that the fruit in this is not another raisin filled box - currants and acai berries, tart and yummy, doesn't stick to your teeth. And NO high fructose corn syrup. This is by far my favorite cereal. I'll even grab handfuls as snacks. So glad I tried this.

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn. They also can be used with dips although they never seem to last very long in our house.\n",

      "I purchased the Brooklyn Bean Roastery Breakfast Blend Decaf K-cups as I am always looking for a decaf coffee that I enjoy and can just continue to order over and over via auto-ship.  My first attempt to brew a cup of this coffee resulted in a cup full of coffee grounds with little to no coffee, as well as a backflow of the same into the Keurig Brewer; as did my second, third and fourth attempts.  I thoroughly cleaned out the Keurig machine and tried again - same results!  I put in a Green Mountain K-cup and it brewed flawlessly.  When I was ready for another cup of coffee, I tried the Brooklyn Bean Roastery coffee again and this time, I did get a cup of coffee, albeit still with a healthy serving of grounds included.  I strained the coffee and was delighted with the flavor.  It appears that for whatever reason, the filter inside the K-cup breaks and releases grounds during brewing, which of course clogs the delivery port of the brewed coffee and the whole process is back-flooded into the brewer.  I have been able to get a cup of coffee from about 1/4 of the Brooklyn Bean Roastery K-cups that I received in my order.  While I really enjoy the flavor of the Breakfast Blend Decaf from Brooklyn Bean Roastery, I cannot continue to purchase them until the manufacture of the K-cup is resolved.  Hopefully, they will be able to do this soon and post a note on Amazon - perhaps list the K-cups as \"New and Improved\" or the like, so that we can know the problem has been addressed and fixed.<br /><br />I have received a replacement box of K-cups from BBR and to my pleasure, every k-cup brewed perfectly.  Same great tasting coffee and now... no grounds!  I will definitely be ordering more.  Thank you BBR for the replacement K-cups and for fixing the original problem with the manufacturing process.  My original rating was 2 stars; I have increased it to 4 stars and if the subsequent orders I get from BBR continue to brew properly, I will increase the rating to 5 stars.\n",

I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all. The very first time I tried taking it again, I was extremely nauseous within the hour. I've even tried taking directly with food, doesn't help. I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame.\n",

      "Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.\n",

Due to the smooth exterior, the \"sea salt\" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual \"fry\"<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally.

I'd rather use a single cup and not waste a second one for a single cup of coffee, but alas, not an option. So if you want bold coffee, then you need to burn two cups - one that is decaf.

I thought it might smell like men's products but it doesn't. I actually prefer using this to my everyday shampoo because it cleans gently and removes all the residue from my hair products.  I also feel like it keeps dandruff at bay. I don't have terrible dandruff but if you do and your products dry your scalp, it can make it worse.\n",

Yesterday I was at my local grocery looking for just plain shredded wheat - not a SINGLE box was not frosted with some kind of sugary coating.  It is no wonder there is an obesity epidemic in this country :-(  Decided I'd check online to see if I could obtain it that way as opposed to in the market - and was delighted to discover that Amazon not only carried it, but it's a Prime item!  I am widowed so 5 boxes will last me awhile, but especially in summer when wonderful fruit is in season, I will be having this for breakfast most days.  Thanks, Amazon!\n",

I was making a lot of milk shakes with the standard McCormick strawberry flavoring, found in most grocery stores, which worked well but was getting expensive.  I thought this might help me save some money.  Boy was I wrong.  No matter what I did, I couldn't get anything resembling a strawberry flavor.  I couldn't believe it, so I literally titrated the stuff into a glass of whole milk with one tablespoon of sugar added.  Drop by drop.  2-3 drops wasn't too noticeable.  By 9 to 10 drops, there was a horrible chemical mouthfeel, almost a mouth burn.  It was as though I was drinking Kodak film developer or something.  Maybe there was the slightest hint of strawberries, but nobody would have found it palatable. Avoid buying unless you know for certain it will work...I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I can't be sure it doesn't somehow become edible after certain cooking or processing steps.\n",

      "Jo-Sef Square Cinnamon Cookies, Gluten Free<br /><br />Genuinely good cookies for a variety of dietary restrictions 4*<br /><br />Though the package highlights the \"gluten free\" aspect of these cookies made with rice and soy flours, they will also provide a pleasant treat for those with a variety of other restrictions:  they are \"processed in a dedicated gluten-free & nut free facility,\" lactose/dairy free, casein free, egg free, wheat and corn free .. plus, are vegan and have no preservatives!  One almost wonders what is left ;-).  They are also low in sodium, have no cholesterol and a smidgin of fiber.  On the other hand, there is a fair amount of saturated fat (4g in a 3-cookie, 1 oz, serving) and a fair amount of sugar (9g / serving).<br /><br />This were mis-categorized in the diabetic treat section of a market and I picked some up for a relative but got to keep them for myself when we noticed the sugar content.  Her loss, my gain, because these are actually quite tasty regardless of dietary goodness.  To my taste, there is a good amount of cinnamon -- neither overpowering nor the mere \"hint\" detected by reviewer S. Campbell (and I like strongly flavored foods) -- and a distinct sweetness.  The texture is excellent, with a crisp bite and fine, but not powdery, granularity.  The sugar cookie comparison used by the other reviewer is close, but these are intriguingly different, perhaps due to the gluten-free flour used.<br /><br />Definitely recommended, if not get out on the street corners and evangelize wonderful, and no doubt a welcome treat for those whose restrictions prevent regular pastries.  They do seem a mite expensive, even at the lower price in the brick-and-mortar store where purchased.\n",

My husband who likes regular soda when he can get it (we drink alot of iced tea and coffee) enjoyed this and all the flavors were a surprise! The flavor that was supposed to be like Mountain Dew was just gross to us, nasty so I took one star off for that flavor. The Dr Pepper version and the ginger ale were the best. I would still buy this in a mix and will give the Mt Dew flavor to my son:o)\n",

      "Vermicelli rice noodles are always a great addition to soup or stir-fry.  This is my first brown rice vermicelli and it fairly similar to white rice vermicelli.  The main differences were the taste and consistency.  The taste is more flavorful and slightly nutty, like brown rice.  The consistency was less pleasing however.  This whole grain vermicelli feels tougher and denser than it's more processed counterpart, as you would expect if you've had whole wheat pasta.<br /><br />Preparing Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is exceedingly simple.  The directions on the bag say to soak for 1 minute in cool water.  I like to use salty broth because they will soak up the flavor of the broth.  If you are eating them in soup, you are done and simply add the noodles to the soup; no cooking is needed.  For stir-fry's you'll want to toss them in a hot wok with your sauce or oil for a minute or two.  If you crisp them up, the consistency is less noticeable.\n",

      "We have now gone through 4 formulas, and here are our conclusions.<br /><br />Similac (non-organic): They use cows which have been given growth hormones.  Seriously, even most non-organic milks in grocery stores do not use growth hormones.  Our baby spent his first four months off the growth-charts until it finally dawned on me to check into this.<br /><br />Similac Organic: Our baby liked this one, but then a NYT article revealed that this formula has a significant amount of cane sugar added - no wonder he liked it.<br /><br />Earth's Best: We really struggled with the transition from Similac to Earth's Best.  We went through a 2 week transition of 3/4 Similac, 1/4 Earth's Best...with a slow increase in the Earth's Best.  Even to our adult taste senses, it had a fishy odor and taste (likely the DHA, which is supposedly taken from seaweed for this brand).  And it NEVER WENT INTO SOLUTION.  We would constantly have to interrupt his feeds to check and see whether the nipple was clogged - being a baby, he would suck and suck -- even when no milk was coming out.  Our baby developed eczema - I am not convinced the formula caused the problem.  Babies get eczema.  But after trying everything else (detergents, lotions, soaps, etc) and reading some reviews questioning whether Earth's Best caused eczema, we decided to try one more formula switch.<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic: \"Now here is something I can add to my coffee when we run out of milk,\" says my husband.  It has a wonderful smell of oatmeal.  No transition needed, our baby finished an entire 8oz in one sitting.  It goes into solution better than both the Similac and the Earth's Best.  No GI distress or constipation when we made the switch.  I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the canisters are small, but scoop for scoop, it is less expensive than Earth's Best.  Just waiting for Amazon to have a \"subscription\" discount.  I highly recommend Baby's Only!\n",

      "I really enjoy naturally flavored spring water so I was excited to review this \"water enhancer\" for Amazon Vine.  The first thing that discouraged me was the list of really unhealthy ingredients. I wish the ingredients would have been listed in the product description.  I would have skipped this offer if I would have known it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose and Polysorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 is used in cosmetics and shampoos so I'm wasn't too crazy about the idea of consuming it. However, since I had agreed to review the product I went ahead and squirted one shot into an 8 oz cup of water.  It tasted like a cup of watered down kool-aid.  The taste wasn't horrible, but the after taste was unpleasant.  I added a second squirt and ended up with a cup of water that tasted like a mouthful of sugar followed by a bad after taste.  My kids also tried it and hated it.  Their exact words? \"That's disgusting\"  I think we will stick to naturally flavored sparkling water.\n",

I think it would be cool if they were available as one or the other to the box. Or even singly, but guess that probably wouldn't make sense through Amazon. I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz. Also, for my druthers, it's overkill on the packaging. Lose the inner boxes, just stick the 24 cans in the one outer box. Oh, kudos on no food coloring.\n",

To me, it tasted like warm black licorice.  I used only 1 bag for 24 oz water and by the time I got about 8 oz of it down, my belly started to bubble so I poured the rest out for fear I would see it again and I threw the rest of the box in the can.<br /><br />It is a 100 % natural herbal tea, just not for me. It is also USDA certified organic.<br /><br />If you like the taste of warm black licorice, it may be useful to you.  I will go back to my chamomile tea for soothing the throat.\n",

      "You can think of the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets as a higher-end version of Hamburger Helper.  The ingredients are a bit more imaginative and the flavor is definitely better.  The chicken and broccoli skillet was definitely tasty and very easy to make.<br /><br />I particularly like that it includes orzo pasta instead of the usual macaroni or shells that you so often see in boxed one-skillet meals.  The flavoring is good and the signature Velveeta cheese adds a delicious creaminess to the dish.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the broccoli really isn't great.  It's freeze-dried, which makes sense considering that this is a non-refrigerated kit, but the pieces are extremely tiny and the taste isn't all that great.  I ended up stirring in some steamed fresh broccoli, and that made the dish taste a LOT better.\n",

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 packets in a box, that gives you 4, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.\n",

      "My border collie mix was having itching so intense that I had to put a cone on her to keep her from destroying her skin. Otherwise, she would chew until she had raw wounds. We took her to the vet and they suggested she may have food allergies. They wanted us to try a pricey kind of Science Diet, but said that we could also start with a lamb and rice formula. The Science Diet was expensive and had of a lot of unnatural ingredients, so we decided to try this dog food instead. It has been great for her. As soon as it arrived she was sniffing excitedly at the bag. We put her on this food immediately because we wanted the itching to stop. I think as a result she vomited a few times in the beginning due to the abrupt change. She also had gas. Now she is nearly through the bag of food and those issues have all but disappeared. Her hair has grown back and her coat is shiny and healthy. No more incessant chewing and no more raw spots!\n",

It has a nice consistency and is easy to spread. You can see the skin through it and tell if it looks better or worse. Unfortunately it caused a rash on my daughter's bottom. I tried it several times to be sure that it was this cream that was causing the rash, and it is. I'm going back to Aveeno.\n",

      "First of all, I ordered this product as pictured and got the Peanut Butter variety. I'm not sure if I was supposed to get Golden or PB, but I'll review the one I got.<br /><br />Why does Nabisco even use the Oreo name for these cookies? They taste good, but they're nothing like an Oreo. The creme isn't like Oreo creme, the single, extra-thin cookie wafer isn't anything like the two thick cookie wafers you get with an actual Oreo, and they're covered in chocolate. Honestly, I don't understand the marketing for this product at all. They took a cookie that has absolutely nothing to do with Oreos and called it an Oreo solely for the product recognition on store shelves. Frankly, it's annoying.<br /><br />So if you're looking for something that tastes anything like an Oreo cookie, this is not it.<br /><br />Do I like them?  Yes. They're OK. They're like the peanut butter Girl Scout cookies. I would probably refrain from buying them again, though. The number of cookies in the package is slightly disappointing, considering the price. I can find the same kind of cookie in a much more cost-effective package without the Oreo name to pump up the price.<br /><br />These are good peanut butter cookies (the ones I got were, anyway) but I was expecting a package of Oreos and got something that bears no resemblance to them. I'd rather they just sold them under a different name, and left the name \"Oreo\" to the familiar cookie with *two* chocolate wafers and a creme center.\n",

I am always looking to better myself from inside out, so I have to credit Shape magazine's interview with Khloe Kardashian for cluing me in to this wonder in a jar.  According to her, Khloe found that ingesting the honey during cold season boosts her immune system.<br /><br />The honey is a pleasant, golden color with a sweet aroma and taste to match; a little goes a long way! I enjoyed the light, sweet taste it brought to my tea. However, I do not always use it since it carries 70 calories per serving. Best of all -- as other reviewers have mentioned -- Manuka honey doubles for more than eating.  I use less than half a teaspoon of the honey as a face mask.  First I boil water and steam my face for about 2 minutes, then I apply the honey in gentle, circular motions.  I steam again for at least 3 minutes, then leave it on for 15-20 minutes. This has not caused me to break out, rather it has cleared up what could have been a pimple or two.  Don't try this if you are allergic, though.\n",

      "I am not on a gluten/wheat free diet. Instead, I came across this brand while shopping in my grocery store organic food isle. Since then, I have eschewed all other brands of spaghetti for Mrs. Leeper's Wheat/Gluten Free Organic Spaghetti. Here is why:<br /><br />1) I find it more filling then \"regular\" spaghetti. Typically, pasta leaves me craving more pasta. Not so with Mrs. Leeper's.<br />2) Tastes like the real McCoy.<br />3) Can be frozen after cooking. I boil the entire bag (6 servings) and place what I do not use in individual plastic containers. I defrost as needed.<br /><br />TIP: do not freeze with sauce. If you do, upon defrosting the noodles will break up into tiny little pieces (each less then an inch long). If you freeze the pasta by itself, either defrost it in the fridge, or put in the microwave on the defrost setting. I finish it off by adding the noodles to the sauce in a frying pan. Stir gently and the noodle length will be mostly preserved.<br /><br />4) Easy to cook. The box says boil 8-9 minutes. I find it needs full 12 minutes. At that point it is still slightly al dente.<br /><br />TIP: I do not bother with adding butter/oil. I have never had this pasta stick. Just make sure the water is boiling before you add the pasta. And stir. When I store, even if it seems like the noodles are sticking, once you heat them up, they will come apart. Be gentle, do not force them.<br /><br />One last TIP: initially, I thought the single servings seemed smaller then they are with \"regular\" pasta. However, once you place the serving on your plate with sauce, it is actually adequate. Enjoy!\n",

      "This is a very smooth coffee!<br />I usually use a french press, 4 scoops for 2 cups @ 4 minutes.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and like the other reviewer said a little on the light side, which can make it very crisp, as I've experienced, in a drip-type coffee maker. (this is a very good thing!)<br />It has some subtle earthy-tones to it as well, and leave a pleasant flavor in your mouth for minutes after drinking.<br />Like all coffee- the way you make it will bring out different flavor profiles, and temperature as well. Higher temperature will bring out more acidity and crispness, lower temperature brings out more 'bold' and 'smooth'. That's 175-190 degrees f.<br />Both ends of the spectrum, and all in between, are good, with this particular variety. You can't say that with all of them.<br />I would recommend this brand to others- fair trade and organic at a pretty decent price.\n",

      "I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.\n",

When I took my first awful bitter sip I told myself just add more sweetener...and maybe some milk. But after a month of drinking this stuff I can't take it anymore! I just can't talk myself into enjoying the bitter taste no matter how cheap it is or how much milk and sweetener I add. I've gotten to the point where I don't even look forward to my morning cup of tea anymore. I'm still giving this 3 stars because it will work fine in smoothies or cooking where the flavor is more hidden (and it is marked as culinary so I guess that makes sense) but they really need to fix that packaging. And really if you're addicted to matcha you almost have to give this a try right? It's SO much cheaper and maybe the flavor won't bother you? As for me?

This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future.\n",

You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just \"lick\" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange \"treat\". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.\n",

      "So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle, it tasted like smoky flavored milk - YUCK! I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch.\n",

I was looking for something minus all the by product and fillers that was a soft food for them. Newmans seemed to be it but at Wal-Mart it was 1.35 a can. I was able to get it here for about 1.00 a can with free shipping with Prime which made a small savings buying by the 24. The cats like it and as I have found with the other dry food they tend to eat less and go longer between feedings before they get hungry again.

      "Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Tea is, to put it simply, divine. Packaged in a pyramid bag made of a mesh that is much more durable than what normal tea bags use, the all natural ingredients combine gorgeously together for a wonderful cup of tea. The ingredients are as follows: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, and sunflower lecithin. So not only is it a blackberry tea, it also has black current, blueberry, and raspberry, making it tailor-made for me since I adore <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEJ8CO\">Twinings Mixed Berry Tea, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, though since that uses black tea and different berries has a completely contrasting, but delicious, taste. At first sip, the strong berry flavors seem to overwhelm the vanilla, but after savoring the tea a bit, the vanilla's undertone actually balances with the berry flavors perfectly. Since I generally only add honey to tea, I first tried it with that, which complements the flavors of Lipton's Blackberry extremely well and recommend over other sweeteners. I love this tea, it's fast become my new favorite, and as someone who's sensitive to caffeine, the fact that it's free of caffeine makes it even better. Lipton has developed a delightful new tea that I'll definitely be getting again!\n",

It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.

      "Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a nice alternative to the normal breeds of soda such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper.  It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.<br /><br />The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.<br /><br />In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a Coca-cola subsitute.\n",

      "This chocolate is divine.  It is rich, does not cause stomach upset and melts like high carb chocolate.<br /><br />I wish amazon carried it at a reasonable price since I am already ordering so much stuff from here, but this chocolate is very over-priced at the time of this review.  You can get 12 bars of any flavor on netrition's website for thirty four dollars instead of the fifty dollars that is currently listed here, they ship anywhere for a flat rate of $4.95 and have a lot of sugar free and low carb items so I am always ordering a lot of stuff and pay just $4.95 shipping, even if the package weighs 20 pounds.<br /><br />Another option is to buy the two poundbags of dark chocolate buttons directly from the low carb specialty website for fourty five dollars with free shipping that includes an ice pack -- per ounce, this is the least expensive way of enjoying Chocoperfection dark chocolate.  The buttons are about an inch across and easier to portion out since a whole bar is too much for me and cannot be divided in half easily; the bars are made up of 5 scored blocks -- so you can have 2 or 3, I wish it was scored evenly.<br /><br />Anyway, I have tried making my own SF chocolate with varied results.  I use the buttons for lots of recipes with no guess work needed.  I often blend it with unsweetened chocolate for really dark chocolate flavor.  What I find really good is to melt 2 ounces ChocoPerfection buttons with 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate and blend with 2-3 ounces organic heavy whipping cream.  Let it set in the fridge and then roll into small balls and dust with unsweetened cocoa, nearly instant truffles with no sugar added!  I use a premium unsweetened chocolate for best results, but any bar found in the baking isle at your grocery store would work.  I don't usually add extra sweetener for the truffle recipe, but I may add a bit of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HBVYP2\">NuNaturals NuStevia No Carb Blend, 1,000 Packets</a> if I need it sweeter -- that stuff rocks also.\n",

But I couldn't really taste the coconut so that came as a surprise to me when I read the ingredients. They are sweet and savory, perfect for a snack when a quick pick-me-up is needed.  They have just the right amount of chewiness, not too tough, but not so soft that the bar falls apart.<br /><br />The bars are larger than regular granola bars, and each one has 220 calories, 12g of fat, 23g of carbs and 7g of protein.  Sodium is 230mg per bar and fiber is 3g.<br /><br />The mouth feel was just right, and the taste was neither overwhelmingly sweet or salty, just a bit of both.

If you have a bear or a St Bernard, you may find these bags too small.<br /><br />These bags also compost as promised, even in my slow, unmanaged home yard composter (don't worry, it doesn't go on any food crops). The bags take about 6 months to a year to degrade completely under these conditions--I would say a few months slower than \"regular\" slow-composting items like corn cobs, for example. It helps if you don't tie the bag off completely, or rip it right before adding to the composter, so the poo microbes can get to work heating up the surrounding compost instead of dying in the plastic while they wait.\n",

      "By itself,in the morning,this would probably be too much chocolate. Cut it with another granola,making a 50% mixture.(Bear Naked brand granola is an excellent chice for the other half of the mix)  Throw some raisins or chopped dates on top,then pour a fair amount of milk over the entire mix. The granola is very crunchy,as it should be,so let the milk saturate the granola a little longer than you would for a 'conventional' cereal. That way,when the granola is gone,the milk has a bit of a chocolate taste and makes for a good tasting final \"slurp\". This granola is very fresh so the extra soak time with the milk will not result in any sogginess. Note: Do not attempt to eat this in a hurry since the original crunchy texture will not breakdown quickly. So, sit back,enjoy the early part of the day and munch on!\n",

      "I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one-cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock-off.<br /><br />Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the \"coffee\" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3-ounce bag.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.<br /><br />I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew-like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee-like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un-coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.<br /><br />I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross.\n",

      "BOB'S VS. BISQUICK:<br />I went to Bob's Buckwheat Pancake Mix (have now gone through two 4-packs!) from using Bisquick, mainly to get away from the refined flour and get some better, whole grain nutrition.  I'm happy I did, and wouldn't go back; it's my body I'm feeding.  The negative is, and some others have noted it here, is that this mix doesn't produce particularly light, fluffy pancakes.  They're good, but not super light like Bisquick did.  Maybe if you beat and fold in egg whites (but I don't eat eggs).  That's not to say they don't rise, or they aren't good, and great tasting.<br /><br />BOB'S VS MADE FROM SCRATCH<br />No comparison.  I bought organic bulk buckwheat flour (which you can get pretty inexpensive in a 25lb bag if you're a nut) from Amazon; search for \"Great River Organic Milling.\"  I then made my own egg-less, butter-less, milk-less version from something I found on the web:<br /><br />3/4c Buckwheat flour<br />3/4c Whole wheat flour<br />1.5 tsp Baking Powder<br />1/2 tsp Baking Soda (I think you could switch this to Baking Powder, but this came from the recepie)<br />1/4 tsp salt<br />1 tbsp (that's tablespoon) Agave Nectar (you can totally skip this; it's a low glycemic index sweetener)<br />2 tbsp olive oil (you could use melted coconut oil if you're worried about the heat on the olive oil).  I wouldn't skip the oil though; buckwheat can be a bit sticky on the pan, even a no-stick.<br />water to consistency (I'm assuming you've made pancakes before; I never measure my water)<br />*Cook IMMEDIATELY after adding the water.  Do not let it sit around for 20 min.<br />*Cook on lightly oiled no-stick pan; I use cast iron and it's great, but you do need a little oil as Buckwheat is a bit sticky.<br /><br />Good lord, they were ridiculously light and fluffy.  Amazingly so.  Blew Bob's out of the water.  I haven't tried 100% buckwheat flour yet, but after doing some more reading, it appears that would work fine as well.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Bob's mix produces pancakes that are so heavy in comparison, because it's basically the same ingredients.  Perhaps it's something about a fresh mix.  Maybe the baking powder/soda goes flat????  I have no idea, but I'm doing all mine from scratch from now on.  No question about it.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />If you really want to just open a bag and use it, I think Bob's is great stuff, and good for you.  If you want super fluffy pancakes, make your own; they're much better, and that way you can also go all-Buckwheat.\n",

Cover with enough water that the lentils rest under about half an inch of water. Add salt, pepper and herbs de Provence set on a medium low heat - cover for a soup, it should be ready in a little less than an hour- or - cook uncovered for about an hour for a more robust lentil side dish or some bed-for-my-salmon main course action.

      "I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their \"no return policy\" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome.\n",

      "As soon as we adopted our black labrador retriever, we switched him away from the cheap-o dog food the breeder was using to another natural dog food brand. His stools were unpredictable, he wouldn't finish the cup or so of food in his bowl at each meal... and then we acquired some sample bags of Natural Balance. WOW, is all I can say. Our dog LOST HIS MIND after trying it. Refused to eat what we were giving him before. He had the good stuff and wouldn't turn back. We switched him over to Natural Balance completely and he's such a healthy, strong, muscular, happy pup! We get so many compliments from other people at the dog park about his shiny coat, appearance and demeanor and we know it has to be the food. Good, whole foods make my husband and I feel great - so why would it be any different with our dog? Yes, it's more expensive than other brands of dog food, but you get what you pay for. We want our dog to live a long, healthy, happy life. We are Natural Balance customers for life! (The food rolls are excellent, too! Our dog goes crazy for them!)\n",

      "I was in the mood for a peanut butter and chocolate treat, but not a peanut butter cup. Being hungry for sweets, I hurried in the store and down the cookie aisle and noticed \"New\" Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cremes; just what the doctored ordered!  When arriving home, I tore into the package and tried a couple and, to my surprise, they were quite good!  They kind of remind me of the Girl Scout Peanut Butter Tagalongs. When first biting into the cookie, there is a very sweet peanut butter taste and then the chocolate seems to over-power it is some.  More peanut butter taste would be nice, but they did the trick for my sweet tooth.  A friend of mine tried one and didn't really care for the cookie, but we all have different taste.  :)\n",

      "Ok, so I haven't really been using these for their intended purpose, which is to have them during a workout or before a workout.  But they're working for me as a soda replacement in the morning.  I need the energy quite frankly and weaning myself off the soda is hard to do.  But these help a little.<br /><br />I absolutely love the flavor of these strawberry banana chews.  They really do taste like strawberries and bananas.  You bite in through the sweeter outer layer and get to the gooey gel filled center which is where the strawberry flavor seems to come from.  And they're addicting.  I can easily put away a whole pack in just a few minutes.  My favorite part is the gooey gel center.  I always love getting to that part.<br /><br />The ingredients are actually really good for something that is essentially candy.  Flavoring is natural, sugar is real sugar.  There's real fruit juices in there and the color is made from carrot and elderberry and a few other natural products.  One pouch is 190 calories, which makes sense since it's geared towards the workout and running crowd.  Actually PowerBar is the official sponsor of IronMan, although not the Ironman superhero, but rather the intense grueling athletic event.<br /><br />For the energy part, it doesn't give me tons of energy.  But it's enough to keep me out of my lack of soda slump.  And I'm sure for runners and other athletic events it provides a good amount of calories and sugar boosts that are needed during an intense workout. But let's be honest, they taste good enough to eat as candy and if you need the extra calories, these will do the trick.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy these again, and hey, if I keep training for Warrior Dash, I'll probably use them for their intended purpose eventually.  A great product that gives a little bit of extra energy.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012\n",

      "...and that's the most positive thing I have to say for this product.  There aren't a lot of choices for decaf for the Tassimo at the moment, but this is not the choice I'd make again.  I brewed a cup, immediately added some sugar and real half & half, stirred, put the cup to my lips and I tasted... bad noodles from Panda Express in liquid form.  Now, normally I would make decaf Cafe Verona or decaf House Blend from Starbucks either in a regular coffee maker or a french press, but I'm not terribly picky; I will drink a cup of decaf from Denny's or Friendly's or wherever, and enjoy it.  This was not remotely enjoyable.<br /><br />I was originally going to give it 2 stars since it nearly tastes like coffee, but after writing this review I've realized there is not a redeeming quality to it.  I will only serve this to someone I don't like when I want them to leave my house.\n",

After trying for a while to remove the bones and skin, I just gave up and threw it out.  Maybe I got a bad can?  If not, you guys need to open a can of tuna and compare product.\n",

Oh, well...the scrumptious flavour of this treat...plus the money one saves by not buying fancier and/or organic chocolate, (at least, not all the time), can easily make a person sleep better at night, as the thought of bank interest compounding, (or stocks going up, etc.), leads to more relaxation, and better sleep!<br /><br />Also, \"3 Musketters\" has 45% less fat than other typical chocolate snacks!<br /><br />So much for \"Health\" benefits of \"3 Musketeers\"!<br /><br />And \"Personal Care\"?  You bet!  Eating one of these wonderous little bars makes one think one is eating a chocolate confection at the court of Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI!  (And or the courts of Peter The Great,<br />King Mongut of Siam....or any other monarch, or at the mansion of any rich and famous person of your choice!)  It is SO easy to forget the \"gourmet\" quality of this smooth little treat, because it is so readily available in candy stores, mom-and-pop groceries, huge supermarkets, and online!  However, the smoothness of this confection, and it's sweet chocolate taste, should not be taken for granted!  There is NO sticky nougat, and NO \"pesky\" nuts, to draw attention from the wonderful texture and magnificient flavour!  (I have read that \"Preppie\" food is boneless...probably skinless and without fat, as well.  No difficulty in prying meat or fish for the upper classes!  So, too, can a readily-available \"3 Musketeers\" be considered an<br />\"upper-class\" treat, even if it doesn't carry a huge price tag.  Nothing interferes with \"chewing pleasure\"...it's just \"chocolate fluffiness\", covered with a darker chocolate topping!<br /><br />(True, if you favour \"rocky road\" ice-cream, then \"3 Musketeers\" Bars may not be for you.  But if you like your steak or fish fileted, and your flavour in your candy-bars to be sweet and true, ....THIS is your snack of choice....just as it is mine!)  Deluxe, inexpensive....wow!  What a bargain!  And it even has the \"OU\" (highest-quality kosher) symbol on each wrapper, as well!<br /><br />If you want to cut calories and fat still further...and/or want a second type of treat from your \"3 Musketeers\" bar, try \"volumiizing\" it.  \"Volumizing\" is a calorie-cutting technique, which can easily be done with a \"3 Musketters\" Bar.  Simply put some milk, (whole, skim or dry), intro a blender, add one or two \"3 Musketters\" bar(s), and whirl away!  Presto....the best \"Malt\" available, outside of the ones I used to have in a neighbourhood, Brooklyn, NY candy-shop as a child!  (In fact, you could even add malt, (Carnation Instant...also sold by Amazon.com), to make a super treat!  Or place \"3 Musketeers\" bars inside a cake batter, for an additional taste experience!  Recipes for this little gem of a snack seem endless!  And no nougat, sticky caramel, or nuts, to get in the way!<br /><br />One thing I miss from the \"3 Musketeers\" bars, as they now are packed, is a picture of Alexander Dumas' 3 Musketeers, themselves, For, of course, it is from this novel that the candy bar gets its name.  Althos, Porthos, D'Artagnon,....where art thou?  Thy pictures surely USED to be on this bar!  This scrumptious,  easily-eaten fluffy little chocolate concoction, which surely would be at home in any French, or other Royal Court, reallt needs your pictures on it again!<br /><br />In the meantime.....bite into this wonderful, easily eaten, chocolate confection masterpiece!  Don't let it's wide availabily make you think of it as a common candy bar...for it is truly a gourmet treat!\n",

      "I buy quality, more natural mac & cheese quite regularly and was a long time customer of Annie's products. Unfortunately I often found that glue and other contaminants (which spark when heated) made it into the finished products Annie's sells. I contacted the company about this and was ignored twice before receiving very brief a reply that there was no danger to the consumer. Call me skeptical but eating glue (it's probably from the sealant used on the box tops) caked to the pasta does not seem to me like a good idea, and I wasn't exactly thrilled with Annie's customer service, which was mostly dismissive (ignored my first two missives to them). There are plenty of great products and companies out there. I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese now, and actually prefer their spirals and elbows to Annie's shells as these also cook much faster than shells.  Furthermore, Back To Nature mac & cheese has the added benefit of employing vegetarian friendly enzymes in their cheese culture, as opposed to Annie's which does not uses animal enzymes. All in all there's no sense taking a chance on eating toxic substances when looking for a healthier alternative to the chemically heavy products from Kraft and the like.\n",

Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.\n",

I've noticed that the bulk-order boxes contain more pasta fragments than the full-price boxes at the health food store, but the Amazon price is unbeatable.

Well, I made some anyway according to the package directions, and my dogs absolutely LOVE it.<br /><br />I have 12 dogs, including one 18-yr-old and one 15-yr-old who are VERY finicky (probably cats in their former lives) and even those two absolutely loved it, so suffice to say it tastes VERY good to them, even though to be frank it smelled kind of iffy to me.  Definitely not a bad smell, just an unusual smell of some sort of herbs, and I was worried that no one would eat it-- Wrong!)<br /><br />To clarify, this is NOT \"8 lb of food for $100\"; this is a mix of freeze-dried vegetables that you combine with meat (raw or cooked) and an egg and maybe some fish oil for good measure.  Even with 12 dogs this will take us forever to get through.  In the meanwhile I'm storing the powder in wide-mouthed jars to keep the moisture out.  You can go to the Urban Wolf website (google for it) to get estimates of how long a bag will last.  Also check out the nutritional information while you are there.<br /><br />I don't plan on using this when lots of vegetables are in season, but for the times of year when choices are fewer, this is a great way to ensure a diversity of vitamins.\n",

      "I used to enjoy coffee from my local Caribou cafe. When I moved to a location that didnt have one I tried the Caribou blend K-cups.  Caribou blend was never my favorite, but it was all the store had at the time, so I gave it a try. The flavor is incredibly flat, one dimensional, with a bitter aftertaste, and generally unpleasant aroma (sour).  It was so off that I checked the expiration date, but found out it was still months away.  I wont buy this flavor again.\n",

      "I have been a subscriber to Gevalia Coffee and tea products for over 10 years.  I started subscribing because of their flavored coffees.  All of Gevalia coffees come in airtight shrink wrapped foil which protects their flavor.<br /><br />Vanilla Nut has a wonderful nutty flavor that the vanilla helps to smooth out.  Once you try Gevalia coffees it will be hard to go back to drinking other coffees.  I tried to save money by purchasing other flavored coffees in my grocery store and the grocery store coffee always tasted stale.  Once I went back to drinking the Gevalia coffee, one sip made me realize that I would never be able to give it up completely.  Their coffee has such a rich and smooth texture that I have never gotten with other coffees.\n",

      "I'm pretty picky about my coffee. It has to be bold. Has to be smooth. Bitter is bad. Burned beans are bad. And hotel conference room coffee from the 100-cup percolator pot is generally the most vile thing on Earth. Little styrofoam cups filled with overheated pool chemicals and mop-bucket waste.<br /><br />In fact, if you've ever taken a sip of the latter and remarked \"hmmm, not a bad cup of coffee!\" then perhaps you shouldn't even consider the purchase of a premium blend, as you would simply be wasting your money. You've destroyed your taste buds and they probably wouldn't be able to appreciate the difference anyway.<br /><br />So I opened the little bag of Melitta with a healthy dose of skepticism. As it was available only ground (given a choice, I grind my own beans), I wondered if it could really be any good.<br /><br />Following the directions on the bag, we put eight teaspoons of coffee in our French press with 24 oz of water, added almost-boiling water, waited about 5 minutes and pushed the plunger. And?????<br /><br />It was quite a bit better than I expected it to be. No hint of bitterness, and low in acidity, it was a very smooth cup of coffee that was lacking in only one area. It wasn't as bold as I would have liked. Having said that, I must say that if a restaurant were to serve this, I'd be thrilled, as I find most restaurant coffee to be less-than-stellar.<br /><br />The Melitta is certainly not going to replace the coffee my wife and I have been purchasing exclusively for the last several years (Raven's Brew, which in my opinion, blows away Starbucks, and even Gevalia), but we'll definitely enjoy the next several pots. Although I may go a little bit 'heavier' on the coffee-to-water ratio next time.<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin\n",

      "If you're on the fence about whether to try this food out for your dog or not, please do both of you a favor and get this food!  This is by far, the BEST dog food I have come across and I have been telling everyone who cares about their dog(s) to get this food for their own dogs.<br /><br />For years, my dog had been having issues with dog food in general, and was diagnosed as having a 'sensitive stomach' which is when I began my quest into dog food research.  Added to this was the dog food recall scare from a couple years ago and I started looking into healthier alternatives for dog food.  First and foremost, I found that about 90 percent of dog food that had been drilled into our heads as being 'good' and 'healthy' for my dog was in fact the exact opposite. Bad food filled with bad things and bad by-products and fillers.  In other words, I had been feeding my poor dog 'junk food' for years and I felt horrible once I discovered the truth about dog food.<br /><br />My dog had been having issues with soft stools, etc. and was not doing well. After several expensive visits to the vet to rule out any serious medical conditions (which they were not going to rule out unless I spent more $$ on more tests to determine this), I decided to start with the food.  I did a ton of research online and came upon this food and decided to give it a try.  I was looking specifically for Organic, Healthy Food made 100 percent in the USA so I would not have to worry about miscellaneous ingredients making their way into my dogs' food (like with the big brand names), which is when I came across Organix Dog Food. Not only did they fit all of my requirements, they went a step further with the Fiber Content in their food.  I learned that most other dog foods had a fiber content of between 1-3 percent making them very low in fiber.  Then I discovered that to be healthy for dogs, they needed a fiber content of 5 percent or higher, which I found out this food had!  Score!<br /><br />I bought this food with all of this in mind and my dog and I have not been disappointed. My dog now loves to eat his Organix dog food, he now has NORMAL stools and he no longer has to go in to the vet for more expensive medical tests.  I can honestly say, this food has been the BEST for him and I am very grateful to have found it.  If your dogs are having similar problems, please give this food a try and I bet you too will be pleasantly surprised.  Thing is, when you switch ANY dogs' food, you have to do so gradually, over about a week or so with their old dog food and the new food until you fully switch them over to the new food.  That said, expect good results at the end of that transition, once they are 100 percent transferred onto this new food.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted to leave this review on here was to help other dog owners out there who are looking for healthier alternatives to their dogs' current food, so their dogs can live healthier, happier lives as well.  Best of luck to you and your dog(s)!\n",

      "My husband and I had been using a different type of popcorn for our popper, but in looking into purchasing it the last time, it was quite expensive so we started looking around for something new.  In our search we came across this popcorn and thought we should give it a try.  We got the same amount of popcorn for half the price, which was huge bonus for us.  Once we received it, we had to try it right away and we were thoroughly impressed with it.  It is even better than the previous brand.  Fabulous product!\n",

My local stores stopped carrying this mix and I'm thrilled to be able to buy the mix through Amazon.  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who wants a moist Bran Muffin. Just add water, oil & egg and stir.  No mixer needed.  They are part of my daily diet.\n",

      "My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars.\n",

      "Having first tried this brand at Trader Joe's and liking it, I decided to take the plunge and buy more in a larger amount.  The shipment arrived with no problems.  I use agave nectar for my morning coffee instead of white sugar and like it because it adds sweetness, not other flavor like honey does (agave has a slight flavor).  While there were no container leakage problems during delivery, I have had some occasional leakage after using the bottle.  Just a drop or two that will run down the side to the bottom, even with a tight cap.  Not a big deal as it cleans up easier than honey with just a little water.  I am very happy with Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave.\n",

      "I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6-Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible. The flavor isn't all that bad but only 2 ounces of the 6 oz package pop. With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone. My solution - off the shelf popcorn with 3oz of canola oil and some sea salt - ¼ the calories, 90% kernel pop and much better flavor.\n",

This particular cookie is one of the wonderful ones and well worth the cost.<br /><br />If you served these and didn't tell anyone, they'd never know these delicious lemon wafer cookies are gluten-free.  They are just the right balance of not being too tart or too sweet and, though I enjoy the chocolate flavor wafer cookies, the lemon ones remain my favorite.  I've taken them along to potluck events and parties and people love them.<br /><br />Eat them as is or garnish a bowl of ice cream with them and you won't be disappointed.

You can also easily stir in some kibble if you want to do that, the texture matches well with kibble.<br /><br />P.S.

Taste-wise it was fine because it's pretty cold right now so it probably hadn't melted at anytime during the trip, though one half of the bar was broken into a few pieces. It wasn't a big deal to me, but take into consideration it is pretty hard to keep chocolate in shape through shipping. The usual Amazon packing with a lot of extra room inside filled with air bags. The 6 bars were stacked and contained in a plastic bag that was sealed. It said \"Ready to Ship\". The plastic was high quality and probably is specially made for Amazon groceries.<br /><br />Price: The price of $25.01 seems a bit much for chocolate but consider you get six 3oz bars of chocolate, so it costs about $4.17 for each bar. Compare it to chocolate you can find in stores such as Ghiradelli and Godiva. Bars of the same size cost around (with tax) $2.13-$4.26. So you're not paying too much of a premium. Maybe a dollar extra per bar, but it really isn't luxuriously expensive, you're just buying in quantity (which not that many people do with chocolate).<br /><br />Chocolate:<br /><br />I like chocolate a lot, but most of the chocolate I eat are from common brands like Hershey's, Lindt, Cadburry, Godiva, and Ghiradelli. If I were to rate these four common brands that I'm sure most people have heard of in America, I would rate them like this:<br />Lowest-end: Hersheys<br />Low-end: Lindt, Cadburry (U.S. version)<br />Med-end: Ghiradelli and Godiva<br /><br />With this chocolate, reading all of the rave reviews, I was anticipating a high-end product or at least med/high-end for my standards. I fully admit I am not a very good judge of food, but for the average American consumer, these are probably the most common kinds of chocolates.<br /><br />This chocolate, in comparison, I would say slightly higher than Med-end. This bar was delicious to have and I'm still craving more, but it wasn't bliss like I expected after reading the reviews. First I drank some water, then I opened one bar. I ate each piece a bit differently to see if I could get the best experience. I ate a whole piece and chewed it in my mouth which didn't give me that much taste. I let one melt in my mouth and that probably tasted the best. I actually tasted a strong resemblance to Ghiradelli milk chocolate. There was a hint of caramel (like the packaging says). Overall, it's good, but it's not amazing. Probably one of the best made-in-U.S. chocolates you can get, but that's not saying much.<br /><br />One of the best chocolates I've eaten, but again, that's not saying much.<br /><br />Worth it? Yes.<br />Beats other American chocolates by far? No.<br /><br />(Edit: I rated it four originally but I've decided to change it to five. The reason why it was at four was because it didn't meet my expectations, which I now don't seem fit. It is at five stars because it is really good for the price of about $4.17 per bar. Thank you.)\n",

      "I really thought I'd like this product.  I love watermelon and strawberry flavors in just about anything so I figured this would be a no-brainer.  My disappointment was almost palpable and I actually had trouble finishing this drink.<br /><br />I'd have to say my primary impression was that I didn't really taste much watermelon or strawberry.  It's possible these two flavors just aren't meant to go together and cancel each other out.<br /><br />It's a little too sweet for me, although there is no added sugar.  I would have liked something with a bit more 'bite' to it.<br /><br />The primary juice ingredient is grape, followed by apple and acerola, then finally strawberry and watermelon (all from concentrate).  I think maybe a little less of one of the first three might have allowed more of the watermelon and/or strawberry come through.\n",

      "This mix can be used to make salad dressing (which is very good)  but is also more versatile. I used it to marinate chicken using ½ cup olive oil and ¼ cup lemon juice and 2 TBSP of mix for six chicken breasts.  Marinated overnight and grilled.  It was excellent, sort of Mediterranean tasting.  Leftovers were fantastic cold in salad.  My two kids, age 12 and 9 enjoyed it as well, it was not too \"spicy\" for them.<br />Handy to have around if you run out of salad dressing, since you can make your own.<br />  It has 5 cal per ¼ TBSP unmixed.  No sugar, no cholesterol, no fat and 220 mg of sodium per ¼ TBSP.  One container makes eight servings of 8 oz of dressing and the bottle says you can keep it up to 30 days refrigerated.\n",

I felt less tired than usual, but there was no jolt of energy.<br /><br />I enjoyed trying this product and feel that it's better than many of its competitors, but I don't think I'm going to go out and buy any.

I have a hard time eating this sause when its dumped over a plate of Mexican food. I use to to heat up weak salsa, add a little kick to soups and what not. The flavor is good, but theres just something about it. I have alot of both sauses stocked up for survival / food storage reasons. It's something to have on hand during hard times. I buy mine from out local Mexican Tienda which we just got not too long ago, anyways if you want to try something hotter then this sause give that Mayan sause a try and be careful with it.\n",

It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else.

I picked up a 3 pack from the grocery store to test it out, cost me like $3 which is insane for instant coffee. $1 per serving compared to 10 cents with other brands. But, when i tried the Starbucks Via Columbia I had no regrets. Far superior then any instant. I'm not big on Starbucks, i have never ordered coffee from Starbucks. In fact, i'm shocked they got this far with the prices and silly names for sizes, etc. The entire experience going into a Starbucks makes me roll my eyes and leave everytime. But anyway, this instant coffee has great roasted taste and aroma. I'll def buy this in bulk from amazon. The 50 count for $29 breaks down to about 60 cents per cup, which the best way to go. You'd have to grind and brew at home to get this quality/price.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

I like it with yogurt and fresh fruit and it is over the top.  Correction:  \"I used to liked it with yogurt and fresh fruit and it used to be over the top.\"  The problem: it does not appear to exist anymore.  I've checked all the local stores, asked the purchasing manager at one, and none of them know why they can't get any.  They've been stocking other Bear Naked products (a very vanilla, sweet brand called Fit Almond Vanilla Crunch) in place of Peak Protein. It is not in stock at Amazon or any of the other net sites, and it is not in stock at Bear Naked's home web page, but there is no explanation by Bear Naked about why and the Bear Naked Faq says nothing about it.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Kellogg's had taken over Bear Naked.

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

She needs decaf, but she doesn't like the weak flavored decaf coffees you normally get/see. This one is a medium roast - so it's a bit stronger.

      "Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of \"Wow!\" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk \"health food\". \"Wow!\".\n",

      "This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.\n",

But then you smell something like scrambled eggs, fried oignon rings and above all the strong scent of espresso...<br /><br />This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.\n",

But just the smell of this tea is enough to turn my stomach. I drank three cups, trying to \"acquire\" a taste for it, since I now have six boxes of the stuff (minimum order)! But it just didn't happen. My husband thought I was exaggerating, so I made a cup for him. Same reaction. I even tried not inhaling in order to bypass the smell before tasting it. It's just awful!!! I'm going to take a box of it to the local library ... first one to say they like it gets the other five boxes!!! Hope I don't get banned from the library!\n",

It's loose tea, but it's not really leaves like the Lipton.  It's more like grounds.  It makes a very strong tea.  I use it for sweet iced tea and use two scoops (have to use 3 scoops of Lipton) and it's delicious over ice.  Very highly recommended.\n",

      "My husband is the big coffee drinker in our household, and he loves the Senseo coffee pod system and the coffee that the pods make. We have the Senseo coffee maker, and he brews the Expresso coffee using the 8 oz setting, because the 4 oz setting that he uses for his Columbian and Sumatra is too strong for the Expresso brew. He loves the flavor occasionally but it's not his favorite -- the Columbian ranks first and the Sumatra second. The great thing about the pod system is that he can brew different flavors and have a cup of each without having to brew a whole pot of any one flavor. The Expresso is very rich and very strong, and a nice change occasionally when he is in the mood for a real coffee \"high\". If someone added sweetener and creamer, it would probably work to brew the 4 oz cup, but my husband drinks his Expresso blend black, so the 8 oz setting is better for his taste.\n",

I worry a lot more about the sugar in a product than the fat, unless it's made with soybean oil or lists trans fat.

Cheese used to work, but he learned pills were involved and can longer be tricked with the cheese. We were driven to the point of forcing the pills down his throat, which wasn't fun for dog or owner. Since getting the Pill Pockets, medicating him is no longer a task. He enjoys the flavor and takes his pills without problems. They are a little pricey, but if you buy them through Amazon you'll save a lot of money. The cost is well worth the results that you receive with these Pill Pockets.

I find the Kitchens of India version to be my 2nd favorite next to Haldiram. It's not too spicy like TJ's, and it is pretty well-seasoned (arguably a little too salty). My only complaint is that the paneer is not as good as Haldiram's version. Haldiram's cheese is \"squeaky\" and firmer to the bite, so it feels more fresh and homeamde. I bought this when it was on sale though for 50% off so it's a great value. I also bought the variety pack and I like to heat up two packages and eat with a little plain yogurt and rice. Perfect for a weeknight dinner and lunch for the next day.<br /><br />Update 1-27-10<br />I'm now down to my last box of this product and I have to say that I'm not going to be ordering it again.

So I found myself eating about eight in one minute which was quite excessive but man they were good.  Even my wife ate quite a few and we both agreed to put the bag up or we would finish it up.  Not a good thing since in four pieces I think there is fifteen grams of saturated fat and around two hundred forty calories.  We usually don't get sweets but when we do we indulge.  When you first eat one it tastes really good but after its been chewed the aftertaste sets in.  I did notice after a couple the taste gets unbearable so I had to drink something.  The dark chocolate is so rich that it is kind of overbearing after awhile but still they are very good.  I wouldn't say its my favorite chocolate but they do offer a certain taste I was looking and I am glad I bought them.  I wish there was a smaller bag to sample them with but we took a gander and really liked them.  Try them out and they might fit your taste.  If you are like me you will find yourself eating one after another which I don't recommend.  Oh yeah I did have major stomach cramps and a case of diarrhea afterwards but it was worth it just for those moments of bliss.  Thank you Donchels.\n",

      "In comparison to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;</a> I prefer the caramel taste of this Cappuccino version. It's a little creamier and sweeter, but still contains traces of a good solid black coffee. I don't drink a lot of coffee mostly because I find it so difficult to find the blend of blackness and cream and sugar. Temperature is also a difficult think to master (it always seems too hot or too cold!) However, this coffee blend is a masterful mix of my favorite sweetness, creaminess, and blackness. It's rich, but not too rich. It's sweet, but not too sweet. And no bitter aftertaste! I refrigerated it and thought it tasted great cold.<br /><br />With that being said, I would never spend $2 on a little tiny 8.45oz can of it. But if coffee is important to you, this is a great-tasting product. And a nice--albeit unhealthy--way to boost your energy!\n",

We didnt have much luck this time, but when I saw this 4 pack on Amazon I knew I had to buy it. THis Halloween was also our 4 year anniversary, so I figure it would be the perfect gift, and it was. She was so excited when she opened the package and saw 4 boxes of her favorite cereal.<br /><br />The boxes arrived on Nov 1, a day late but that was my fault for ordering it too late but it didnt matter to her.

They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.\n",

      "I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell.\n",

While I was shopping, I found the same type of tea from Eden.  The Eden tea appealed to me because it was organic, got great reviews, and was more expensive than the Yamamotoyama brand, so I assumed it was better quality.  When I got the tea, I made a cup of each at the same time to compare.  I was surprised to see that the less expensive Yamamotoyama was a little darker, and the roasted brown rice flavor was stronger.  I realize the roasted brown rice green tea is considered inferior, but if you like that taste, I think more of it is better.  I think the reason for the difference is that, the Yamamotoyama had about twice as much tea in the bag as the Eden.  I'll try to post some pictures.\n",

      "POISON \"Chlorhexidine\" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, \"Chlorhexidine\" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  \"Chlorhexidine\" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their \"vet/doctor\" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that \"serious\" problems may occur, especially if your dog \"licks\" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; \"conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose\" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same \"intellectual scientists\" who've managed to put half our nation on \"safe for you\" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, \"prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration,\" leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay.\"<br />Japan stopped using \"Chlorhexidine\" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats \"grooming\" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? \"And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?\" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc.\n",

      "Got these mixes (12 boxes)for my Mom when she was no longer able to find them locally.  She was thrilled.  I asked her what she liked about them and said \"they make a meal festive\".  She's 89, lives alone and still makes most things from scratch but, after giving this mix a try several years back, she said she preferred it to all the work that was involved.  She said the mix is similar, if not the same, to what she made from scratch -- I agree.  And I'm happy that it's much less work for her.  I think she makes dumplings more often than she normally would because they're so easy.  And since she really enjoys them, I'm glad.<br /><br />She said they have a new box that suggests substituting milk for water and she's said that although she always liked this mix with water, she likes it even better with milk.<br /><br />We used to get this mix in NYC and bring it to her whenever we visited but now, with Amazon, it's so easy to just order 12 boxes and have them shipped directly so she never runs out.\n",

      "My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various \"squeezie\" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to \"eat\" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.\n",

      "My 12 lbs (4x 3lbs) of gummy bear arrived yesterday. The candy comes in large(!) resale packaging. I opened up one package right away to check if there is a truth in the complain that many people seem to have with this product.<br />In short: yes, the candy tastes \"older\" than those small packages you can pick up from your local grocery store, but for me this is an advantage:<br />When I buy a package of gummy bears (and it has to be the Haribo brand), I open a package and let it sit for 2-4 weeks to \"ripe\". I can't stand the strong artificial taste/smell of fresh gummy candy products.<br />In my opinion, the longer the gold-bears can breeze, the better the taste gets. Plus, because they get harder to chew, you eat less of them.<br />I don't know yet what the perfect age for gummy-bears is, because once they get a couple weeks old and start tasting good they are suddenly all gone ;-(\n",

      "...this coffee tastes horrible.<br /><br />Having not learned my lesson to never look a gift horse in the mouth, I complain every chance I get about this smelly swill my employer buys to caffeinate the troops. In fact, it is this sort of indiscretion that lead me to bringing my own press pots, digital gram scale, and Costco french roast (yes, lowly mass-batched beans!) to work.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a caffeine buzz, this will do the trick. But the cost is an acidic after taste that camps out on the tongue for the next few hours. Usually, I equate lighter roasts such as these with \"inoffensive,\" i.e. suitable for general audiences, including those who don't want a coffee to overwhelm them. Some (myself included) might even say \"bland.\"  In acts of desperation when supplies are running low, I've supplemented my mellow dark roast with a scoop or two of this -- and its \"flavor\" adds a sour exclamation point that can't be masked.<br /><br />I'm not the only one who detests this brew: a few of my coworkers have similar sentiments, though are either too cheap to bring their own, or just aren't as passionate (aka abnormal) as I. And maybe this is work's way of cutting down on coffee consumption, which isn't all bad since there are Peet's and Starbucks nearby.\n",

      "I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a \"cheap drinker\" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.\n",

      "Several years ago I began looking for ways to cook with less fat.  One technique is to use soup stock in place of fat for flavor.  I would buy soup stock only to use a few tablespoons to glaze my pans for cooking, and felt wasteful when the rest went bad.  I tried freezing into cubes, but found that to be time intensive and a storage problem.  So for years I used boullion cubes.<br />Now, my husband loves salt but wouldn't eat the grits I made because they were too salty. The only salt added was from the boullion.  Now the grits taste better, I can easily mix a pinch of soup base with water to  glaze a pan, and of course use it for gravy and soup base like most people.<br />This product costs less per serving than boullion, and doesn't have the storage problems of canned soup stock.  This base actually makes a better stock than most of the canned or carton stuff, anyway!<br />This has been a great addition to my regular panty staples.\n",

There's always a fresh cup that is delicious and satisfying.

      "Although this product tastes good and has a decent amount of fiber, it's sweetened with HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.  HFCS, which is present is many processed foods and drinks, is suspected of slowing metabolism, contributing to high triglyceride levels, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and obesity.  Read a comprehensive article about the dangers of HFCS here:  [...]<br /><br />I prefer to steer clear of HFCS as I believe it's unhealthy.  Therefore, I purchase Nature's Path Organic Smart Bran as my breakfast cereal.  It doesn't contain any High Fructose Corn Syrup ~ just organic evaporated cane juice as the sweetener.  The taste is GREAT and each serving contains 51% of the RDA of fiber!\n",

Great for quick meals and a very reasonable price compared to the cost per can at a regular grocery store. Other pros include: BPA free can,organic, no added salt, limited ingredient list (peas,water,seaweed). Please note that you can't even tell the seaweed is in the can. I flavor mine with a little onion and garlic powder, a pinch of sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Add a little liquid smoke for a smokey taste without added fat,sodium,or meat.

After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.

      "I love the Yogi brand range of tea and this is one of my favorites. This green tea has a strong lemongrass scent and flavor which makes it really refreshing and a great pick-me-up. I drink a cup daily and it makes me feel rejuvenated and energized. The tea contains grapeseed and amla extract which are natural antioxidants, so drinking this also has detoxifying benefits. The herbs contained in this tea are mostly organic, i.e. organic lemongrass, organic green tea leaf, organic licorice root, jasmine green tea leaf, organic alfalfa leaf, organic burdock root, organic dandelion root, and irish moss powder. There is a small amount of caffeine in this tea, about 21 mg which is still way less than the amount of caffeine found in regular coffee. I love it!\n",

The one I got had an expiration date sometime in 2013, so these are not leftovers or close to expire products. Keeping it refrigerated, preferably in an air tight container, will increase it's shelf life. Just a reminder that this is not active dry yeast, but instant yeast. If your recipe asks for active dry yeast, you should adjust the amount accordingly. I have used this yeast in more than four bread recipes, including pizzas, focaccias and ciabattas and the results were all fantastic! I highly recommend this Fleischmanns Instant Yeast.

All my Finn friends who grew up eating this candy stated it is authentic and delishious.  No one I shared the candy with was disapointed.  I love it.  Can't beat the price.\n",

Your cat would probably love the taste of the $5 bag of mass market garbage on the shelf at your local grocery store (NEVER buy pet food from a grocery store - do you buy food for your own consumption at an animal store?).  That $5 bag of slop comes with a much higher price.  Many of the big brand cat food producers use ingredients of poor quality and aren't easily digestible.  Many of these same companies test their food on cats kept locked up in small cages 24x7.

Less processing with the unbleached.

It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.\n",

      "I'm sitting here this morning drinking a cool and refreshing Guayaki Yerba Mate and it reminded me that I have not yet done a review on my most favorite drink. Guayaki mate comes in many forms; dry loose-leaf tea, tea bags for steeping, and sweetened, flavored iced tea. I was first introduced to the joys of mate over a year ago by my tea-savvy sister-in-law. She was so devoted that should could not help but tell everyone she knew about the awesome powers of mate. Yerba Mate is made from a holly tree that grows in the South American Rainforest and the native people have been drinking it for centuries. In fact the natives call it the \"drink of the gods.\" Mate contains a cousin of caffeine that many have dubbed \"mateine\" which wakes you mentally without all the negative side effects that caffeine has. It doesn't give you the jitters, or an upset stomach, or the sweats. It just gives your brain a little energy boost slowly but very effectively. Mate also contains many antioxidants, even more than green tea!<br /><br />The plain hot tea tastes very similar to plain green tea and is great on a chilly morning. They have recently started selling flavored versions of the hot tea (at least at the store near me) but I have not had a chance to try them. I know one of them is mint flavored and I would bet that it's tasty. The sweetened and flavored ice teas are beyond delicious. They come in Revel Berry, Lemon, and Mint flavors and I have tried all three. I'm not a big fan of the mint flavor, but my husband thinks it's the best of them all. My personal favorite is the Revel Berry flavor.<br /><br />Best of all, Guayaki is Certified Organic, Fair Trade, Kosher, and Non GMO. Guayaki is committed to helping the farmers earn a decent living as well as restore the Rainforest. According to the Guayaki can, \"Guayaki's mission is to steward and restore 200,000 acres of South American Atlantic Rainforest and create over 1,000 living wage jobs by 2020\". So, we can rest assured that the delicious beverage we are enjoying is going to actually HELP the Rainforest instead of ruin it. So drink up!\n",

That may be because we tried to eat it as a main dish, but I wasn't able to stand eating it like that (unlike all the other flavors of pasta sides) until I made some buttered toast to pair with it. If I eat each bite with a bite of toast, then it's tasty. If its plain though, I don't think I could eat very much of it. So my suggestion for those who weren't crazy about it but didn't hate it: try making some plain toast with butter, OR make some texas toast in the oven and pile some of the pasta on top of it before serving. You might like it a little more then :)\n",

      "Nature's One deleted my post from their Facebook page so I am posting my doctors recommendations here.<br /><br />If there is any question whether this company is hiding something it was quickly answered after they deleted my post in which I described recommendations that I received from the toxicologists at Environmental Health Sciences at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA.  This department specifically deals with public health issues regarding environmental toxins so I believe their opinions are less biased than that of Natures One or their \"independent researchers.\"<br /><br />Anyway, I have been feeding my baby this formula since she was born 5 months ago.  I was concerned after hearing the news report regarding the levels of inorganic arsenic in the brown rice syrup so I called my local pediatrician who recommended that I call Children's Hospital.  The toxicologist recommended that I stop using any formula that contains brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient along with any other baby food products with it until they have more information. He mentioned the Dartmouth study stating the brown rice syrup has well over the recommended amount of inorganic arsenic, about 6x times past the limit.<br /><br />It was a relief to hear from the toxicologist that I need not worry about any acute or chronic arsenic toxicity for my baby, and that she does not require any urine, blood or hair tests.  This is in contrast to what many other pediatricians have recommended for their parents who are feeding their children the same formula.  The toxicologist believes that my daughter's risks to developing any illness, cancer etc was less than 1% greater than a child who had not been given the formula, so that was very reassuring.<br /><br />After hearing these recommendations from Children's Hospital I could see how someone would still continue using the Natures One product because the health risks are low, however I opted to switch because I realize my role as a parent is to reduce any risks to my child, even if it is less than 1%. There are so many other chemical risks out there that I feel any risks that you can take off the table would help protect my child because it is probably the cumulative effect off all these chemicals that leads to adverse problems. And i figure if those people who have a Masters in Public Health are recommending to discontinue it who am I to disagree with them.<br /><br />An ethical company would have taken the Dartmouth study information and told the public that they will try to improve on their product, ie. reduce the inorganic arsenic, however, they still claim they make the finest baby formula out there.  Their website says they are looking out for the health of our children but refuse to recall or change their product which speaks for itself.<br /><br />In light of them deleting my post above from their Facebook page, it appears that they definitely have something to hide, as I was just posting public health information that I felt people in my situation would like to know given to me by one of the most reputable health institutions (Children's Hospital) in the world.<br /><br />Obviously, I would give this product zero stars if I could.  Hope this info helps some of those confused, concerned parents out there like me.<br /><br />UPDATE #1*** please read the article from the Huffington Post written Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist from Yale.  It is in line with the recommendations from Children's Hospital of Boston.<br /><br />UPDATE #2*** I received a response from Dr. Gary Ginsburg in response to the new testing results by Nature's One.  Looks like their testing results indicate an even worse situation than originally thought.  Here is the response from Dr. Ginsburg: \"Seeing your comment made me hopeful that this is just lab error, a false alarm. However, saying that Dartmouth doesn't know how to measure arsenic is like saying Roger Federer doesn't know how to play tennis. The Nature's One press release sounded scientific - they explain how the Dartmouth analysis was different from their method and why theirs was better. But when you click on their own results - in 3 samples of their baby formula, the inorganic arsenic is actually greater (53 to 83 ppb) than the Dartmouth results (10-20 ppb)!! So calling the Dartmouth results too high and flawed is an insult to Dartmouth as well as to all of us. Further, they compare their results to an outmoded WHO (CODEX) arsenic acceptable intake of 2.1 ug/kg/d. This was withdrawn in the latest CODEX because it was too close to the cancer effect level and CODEX did not supply a new value. Nature One claims that Dartmouth relied on the 2.1 ug/kg/d value but in fact Dartmouth used 0.3 ug/kg/d (the dose corresponding to USEPA's drinking water std) to compare against. If Nat1 used that target, their baby formula would be in the danger zone, so they chose the withdrawn target instead. The bottom line is that the company's own data make the situation worse, with levels of arsenic in their baby formula 5 to 8 times greater than the USEPA drinking water standard for inorganic arsenic (10 ppb).\"\n",

The concept of this water seemed sound unlike the sugary drinks that are typical advertised with artificial neon colors and poured over coaches at the end of a winning game.<br /><br />Personally, I'm a big fan of coconut water after hard training, so I have a bit of bias.  The most notable problem I had with this drink is it didn't taste like water should.  The water tasted \"metallic\" which sort of makes sense at a 9.5 pH.  I could barely drink it down as it didn't taste right to me, but I did.  I noticed no benefit after drinking it and felt I had more cramps and shakes than after drinking other replenishing beverages.<br /><br />I see no benefit to this product and it simply doesn't taste right to me.\n",

I started getting stomach aches, really bad ones, the type I get if I stuff my face FULL of WHOLE WHEAT. I can eat pizza till I faint and I still won't feel this bad. And bad, bad, headaches. I don't understand it at all. I know if I eat a lot of oatmeal (serving size) I feel sick also, but this doesn't compare. I don't know if it's the artificial coloring, flavors, oatmeal and traces of wheat, BHT or WHAT. It's just a bad combo. I've read from other people that all the other Chex Gluten-Free can have similar effects on some people. I also read Chex Gluten-Free tests POSITIVE FOR GLUTEN on the EZ Gluten Test Strip. Pretty bad for a cereal that claims to be gluten free. :/<br />I give it a star because even though it tastes great, I don't like to be blindsided by wheat. I rather eat a pizza.\n",

      "I am a huge lover of chocolate and just hearing the word \"megafudge\" makes me drool.  I was very excited to try out these cookies from Chips Ahoy.  At first, even though I am a chocoholic, I was worried that these may be a bit overly chocolately.  However, after taking my first bite, I was in chocolate bliss.  The soft outer cookie and ooey gooey inner flow of chocolate was the perfect combination.  Normally I am not a fan of white chocolate, however these little white chocolate bits were not overly sweet and basically created a bit of a crunch, rather than that overly sweet flavor that is so common with white chocolate.  The different textures of gooey chocolate with soft outer shell and slight crunch all work together wonderfully.<br /><br />Yes, these cookies are sweet and rich.  One or two will be the perfect cure for any chocolate craving that you may have.  As a cookie and chocolate lover, these were perfect.  Between my two kids and I, the bag was gone in a couple of days.  These are also perfect with a cup of coffee as an afternoon treat/pick-me-up.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing these several times in the future and look forward to trying the Chips Ahoy!

      "I had never heard of monk fruit until I saw the ad for nectresse. I'm always up for trying a natural non-caloric sweetener (like stevia).  So, I thought I'd give this a try.  Before I even opened the package, I was disappointed.  The number one ingredient is erythritol (from WikiPedia- Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol) is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States[1] and throughout much of the world. It was discovered in 1848 by British chemist John Stenhouse.[2] It occurs naturally in some fruits and fermented foods.[3] At the industrial level, it is produced from glucose by fermentation with a yeast, Moniliella pollinis.[1] It is 60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost noncaloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is partially absorbed by the body, excreted in urine and feces.)  I'm in the cosmetics industry and one thing I've realized is what you call \"natural\" is subjective. Erythritol is produced from glucose (a sugar) by fermentation with a yeast. You *could* call that natural.  You might not.  But, in either event, the advertising and the package says prominently \"Made from Monk Fruit\".  Monk Fruit (extract) is the third ingredient on the list after sugar and before molasses.  So, if this has zero calories and the second ingredient is sugar, I have to assume it's mostly erythritol. It seems the monk fruit extract is added just so they can put on the label \"made from Monk Fruit\".<br /><br />Now, as for the product itself.  It's fine.  It dissolves great in my hot tea.  It tastes similar to sugar (or stevia). I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it though and wouldn't consider it any more natural than other non-caloric sweeteners you might have found.\n",

If you read it, however, they attempt to convince you that nothing is wrong with selling it long after the sell-by date. Don't believe them! The coffee tastes like dishwater. In all fairness to them I guess, they offered to refund my money minus shipping if I would send it back. They'll just sell it to some other poor sucker, so I'll toss it and feel better about the coffee not going to anyone else. You just lost a customer, Nicorazz.\n",

When I took my beagle Regal to the vet for eating something weird in the back yard (at least that's my guess), our verterinarian recommended Greenies Pill Pockets.  What a dream come true.  No mess, you just slip them in the little hole and seal them up, and the medication is down the hatch without finding it spat out on the floor in some place the dog thinks is clever to hide the evidence.  They don't smell, and both our dogs love the way they taste.  They're a little pricey, but if you want your dogs to take medication mess free and fuss free, these are an excellent way of doing it.

I have been trying to find Pad Thai in a box that I can heat up quite easily and eat it quickly, since I do not have time to go to the Thai restaurant in my city all the time! However, every single time I've tried Thai food in a box, it is nasty. This is no exception.<br /><br />One weird thing is that the noodles already felt damp when I opened the package. And then I opened the sauce packet....oh, I just about lost my appetite then. Pad Thai does NOT smell like that!!! It smelled similar to soy sauce, but worse. And then I tasted it...the taste was not any better and the aftertaste is even worse.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this. I'm never trying Pad Thai in a box again.\n",

      "I like trying different teas (primarily non-herbals), and after hearing about Pu-erh I was intriqued.  From what I've read so far, I believe this particular version is not aged like the very high-end, expensive, caked versions are, but it seemed like a good way to get a taste of this tea variety.  I am not disappointed at all.  Though it's not a drastic departure from other teas, it's not quite like any I've had before.  It's very mild and earthy, with a subtle sweetness -- VERY pleasant!<br /><br />Something else that sets it apart from other (non-herbal) teas: It doesn't get bitter after extended steeping!  Furthermore, as I've read elsewhere, just one serving goes a long way.  In fact, I never stop steeping it.  When my cup is almost empty, I just top it off again.  I get at least four flavorful cups with just one of the prewrapped nuggets.<br /><br />This instantly became one of my favorite teas.  I'm delighted I finally discovered it, and just may have to spend the $ to try one of the more expensive/exotic versions.  If it's even better than this, I would understand why folks are willing to pay such a premium $.\n",

      "Like many people who have heard about the benefits of fish oil, I tried taking Omega-3 fish oil capsules. All was fine and dandy except that the fish oil capsules make me feel nauseous, and despite trying everything, I ended up belching up the disgusting taste of tuna ALL DAY LONG no matter how much food I ate, what type of food. The regular capsules were disgusting.<br />My stomach is sensitive to vitamins, so I have been taking the regular gummy vitamins, along with an iron supplement.<br />Seeing that this brand has worked so well for me in the past, I decided to purchase these gummy fish [...].<br /><br />Yes, they do smell and taste faintly of fish. But hello people! It's FISH oil. Of course it's going to smell and taste that way! If you're like me and find the \"grown up\" version of these to be absolutely stomach churning, then the gummi version will be a welcome addition to your vitamins collection.<br /><br />They are fruit flavored, and the fruit taste is what lingers around, not the fish one. Yes, it's weird to have fruit and fish together. But these do not upset my stomach, or leave me tasting fish all day long. So it's worth it.\n",

      "This is a pretty good cocoa for your Kuerig brewer, and has a nice and rich taste at the \"small\" setting of my Keurig: if you want a less-rich experience, just try the medium or the large setting as there will be more water vs. the flavoring than the small.  My son and I like it at the small setting, while my wife and daughter prefer the medium setting (none of us cared for the large setting).  Don't forget to add the marshmellows!<br /><br />One trick to getting a better experience for the hot chocolate in your Keurig is before you put the pod in the Keurig, make sure you shake the pod real well in order to break up the clumps of the cocoa powder: you need to do this as it tends to clump (no matter what brand of K-cup hot cocoa) and breaking the clumps up allows you to draw out more of the flavor vs. more of the hot water.  After all, you paid a lot for the cocoa!<br /><br />One thing I do after brewing each cup of cocoa is to run a medium setting of hot water in order to clean the Keurig by just raising and lowering the pod holder and closing it without a pod into it and then running a medium cup cycle: make sure you put an empty cup under the unit, and you will see what I mean as some of the cocoa powder gets in to the Keurig's lines.  Once you flush it out, just discard this dirty water (you'll be surprised). I highly recommend this as, for example, if the next thing you brew is coffee you don't want to have a hint of cocoa in your coffee.\n",

      "Where to start~~ First of all I would like to say I have always loved Ritz crackers. Secondly I believe I'm at fault by not reading the reviews before I purchased this product. With a one and one half star out of five, I should've spent time in reading the reviews and why it didn't have a better rating. No one as of yet has mentioned the fact that it's not the same Ritz cracker that you would buy in the grocery store, at least to my knowledge. This product is clearly marked \"made in China\". There is no information on the website I could find that said this was an imported item. Thirdly, as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the product (package crackers) are broken as the other reviewers have mentioned. Last but not least-the taste. To me, who've been eating Ritz crackers ever since they came out, the taste is totally different than a partial box of Ritz crackers I had in my cupboard. The only way I can describe this is more of a wheat like taste very unlike the original American made Ritz cracker. I have to say though, that Amazon.com customer service was very good about this and refunded me the money I spent as I am a person who believes in buying as much American-made product as I can. I am not a complainer and most of the items I've received from Amazon's gourmet foods have been packaged well and are as described on Amazon.com's website accurately. If you are Chinese, please do not take offense to this as most of the electronic items in my home (name brand items like Samsung etc.) are made in China or another country outside of the United States. When it comes to food however, I prefer to stick to America-made products exclusively-does that make me a bad person?.<br /> I never thought at my age ( almost 70 years old and disabled) that I would be spending time writing reviews although I'm aware that most Americans would like to know where their food is made. That's about it and good luck shopping.\n",

      "I grew up with green tea (I'm from Japan)- I was always searching for good alternative to the loose green tea (wanted something quick, single serving, easy to clean, and yet tastes good).  Well, my search is over, finally!<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-Tastes very fresh, the color is very green,<br /> not that yellow-ish green<br /><br />-Added Maccha to enhance the flavor<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-The naming is bit confusing.  I can see why some people order this product, thinking that they are getting the Maccha powder (the one for the tea ceremony).  This is NOT a 100% Maccha poder.  It is a delicious, fresh green tea blended with maccha powder.<br /><br />Quick Tip<br /><br />If your green tea tastes too bitter, the water might be too hot.  The best temperature is around 80C (176F- NOT boiling hot). After pouring the hot water, steep about 30-45 sec, then take the bag out.  You never want to \"cook\" the green tea.<br /><br />Hope this helps :)\n",

      "I've been drinking Yogi teas for a couple of years now.  Just happened upon it at a health food store and wanted to try it.  The medicinal Yogi Tea line is fantastic.  It does exactly what the box says it will do... which is strange because I have tried many medicinal teas that have not given me any type of immediate or noticable results.  I can have a tummy ache, drink a 6-8 oz cup of Yogi Stomach ease and half way through the cup my stomach ache is gone.  The same goes for their bedtime tea:  once I drink a cup I can lay down, close my eyes and I'm out cold and in a deep/restful sleep.  This stuff is way better than the supermarket celestial seasonings line.  Twinnings or Traditional Medicinals don't compare either.  One important thing to be aware of regarding the Yogi line:  these teas are spicy and heavy.  Many of them have spices like cardimom, cinnamon, black licorice root, stevia leaf... some even have black pepper listed as an ingredient... they're loaded, but oh so good!!\n",

      "When I began cooking for myself about 6 years ago, I tried five or six different recipes for chicken vindaloo, from Madhur Jaffrey's classic recipe to actor Anthony Hopkins' \"healthful\" one (which I found on some entertainment Web site).<br /><br />Most were good, with Jaffrey's being the best of the bunch, Hopkins' the worst (Hannibal's take on vindaloo was surprisingly bland). None of the recipes were nearly as good, however, as the spiced-just-right vindaloo I used to order at least once a week from Baluchi's when I lived in New York City.<br /><br />During my recipe experimentation, I visited a local Asian grocery store and asked the clerk for some advice. He recommended trying Patak's paste. I was dubious, but I did. It was absolutely great. And the bonus: The Patak's recipe is much easier to fix than the various recipes I had been collecting.<br /><br />I've cooked with this paste so often now, I've learned to make a few alterations to the recipe. I basically follow the directions on the jar (substituting chicken for shrimp), but add a 1/4 cup of yogurt and about a tablespoon of fresh minced cilantro at the end of the cooking process. If I have some lemon juice around, I put in a couple of squirts just before serving. (I usually cook the dish with two to two-and-a-half pounds of chicken and freeze the leftovers. It reheats well.)<br /><br />If you're using chicken breasts rather than dark meat, make sure not to overcook and dry out the chicken. That's about the only thing you'll need to guard against. (A friend told me to marinate the chicken bits in yogurt and then cook them under a broiler, separate from the sauce but adding them to the sauce once they're cooked through. He says this locks in the moistness and adds a little flavor to the meat via the slight charring/carmelization that results. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.)<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure how healthy this paste is; don't overuse the paste or the dish can get a bit greasy, for example. (There must be a fair amount of oil in the paste.) Just use the amount recommended on the jar and you should be fine.<br /><br />Patak's doesn't beat Baluchi's chicken vindaloo, but for a home cook looking to make fast and tasty vindaloos, this paste can't be beat.<br /><br />Now if I could just learn to make a quick-and-easy naan, I'd really be in business...\n",

These are soft, not too sweet, less calories (about 1/3 less than sugar sweetened), and flavorful. They are sweetened with sugar alcohol (malitol), so moderation is key. A small handful is all you want to eat at once in order to avoid gas and gastrointestinal distress. These are a great alternative to sugar sweetened candy if you can't eat sugar, are dieting, or are looking to protect your teeth from decay. The sugar alcohol consequences are a good way to limit yourself! Also, if you aren't sure if you are sensitive to sugar alcohols, it's a good idea to try a small bag like this before buying the 5 lb bag!\n",

      "I used DaVinci for years, until Walmart stopped selling the entire brand. The brand they switched to carried sugar free Hazelnut but for whatever reason Walmart elected not to inventory the flavor. Bad decision, but that's another review.<br /><br />After using this brand, Torani and then Oscar's I have to say that I really appreciate this one the most. It has a great Hazelnut flavor.<br /><br />The only reason it gets four stars is the price. A whopping $8.20 per a 750/ml bottle is absolutely too expensive. Even Starbucks' own label isn't that much. The awful Torani is $5.40 (it comes with 3 bottles at $16.30 + free shipping), yet again, it's awful but it IS cheaper. Oscar's isn't available for now, but I only paid $5.06 per bottle (+ shipping)! Oscar's is almost as good as DaVinci. The only problem with it is that at the time of this review, Oscar's are out of stock here at Amazon.<br /><br />If you don't mind the expense, then you'll like DaVinci. It has a great flavor. If you're wavering over the cost, look elsewhere before buying. Just whatever you do, don't buy Torani's unless you like pancake syrup! Trust me.\n",

      "I read most of the reviews (especially the negative ones) about this product before purchasing and knew of the possibility that this particular model may not fit the brand of natural PB my wife likes (16 oz Natural Organic PB from Trader Joe's in a plastic jar).  I decided to get it because there was a decent chance it would fit.  Without opening the package, I could tell it wouldn't fit.  This could have easily been avoided if the specs were included in the product details.<br /><br />Anyone purchasing this or similar models should know that there are 6 DIFFERENT MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM:<br /><br />#100 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 77mm lid<br />#200 -- twist knob mixer for 16 oz reduced fat jar with 77mm lid<br />#300 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 70mm lid<br />#400 -- crank mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#500 -- twist knob mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#600 -- twist knob mixer for 36 oz jar with 99mm lid<br /><br />The product considered in this review refers to Model #100.  Those of you who want it to fit on the Trader Joe's PB that I mentioned earlier will need to get Model #300.<br /><br />As I said in the subject, this product looks like a great idea, but the marketing lacks an important fact (which I find unnecessarily deceptive) so I am giving it a sub-par rating.  It does NOT take much effort to list these very important specs that would help people buy precisely what they need, especially when this info is contained on the back of the product itself.<br /><br />I found the #300 model on another site and am purchasing it separately.  I'm also returning the one I got here.<br /><br />If you're going to get this product, pull out a ruler or measuring tape and measure your lid to ensure you get the right fitting model.

I found this out the hard way, not a big deal because I was able to return the product without a hassle, great customer service on amazon.  I have learned that pure stevia powder, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ\">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a> contains no xylitol and certain liquids do to but if they do not explicitily say it in the product description, you can be sure that it will contain xylitol since its cheaper to sell it that way.  I'm just glad that I have an alternative to sugar substitues like equal and splenda because for some reason my taste buds could never get use to those artifical sweeteners.\n",

      "I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br /><br />Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, \"The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle?\" Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br /><br />Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a \"fishy\" smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br /><br />As for the texture? Not at all \"rubbery\", but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br /><br />What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a \"fleshy\" quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br /><br />So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance.\n",

It's spicy, flavorful, aromatic... it's so far above the other stuff I can't imagine going back. In fact, I now use my other organic cinnamon on my doorstep to keep the ants out of the house. I'll only use this stuff for our food needs from now on. Shipping was flawless, too.\n",

I found this claim to be true, as did some of my relatives.  This is a tasty way of \"taking your medicine.\"  The only negative is the 80 calories in those 2 tablespoons.  This is not a huge amount, but calories do matter even a small amount.  However, I would suggest that the benefits outweigh the negatives.\n",

I'd only eat one again if there was absolutely nothing else in the house.<br /><br />I tried Nature's Path Organic Frosted Strawberry Toaster Pasteries simply because \"he\" threw it into the shopping cart, insisting it had to be good.

There is absolutely no chemical after-taste. And, there is fruit inside. Yes, I was astonished. It was not like a slab of stale jello, but real, tasty strawberry with a nice, natural taste.

      "Firstly, I have been using this specific deodorant for 4 years. I originally started using it when other products started to give me an under arm rash, I noticed this one said for \"sensitive skin\" so I gave it a try. Since I have been using it I have not got any more rash or redness. It has a nice, pleasant smell and is not overpowering. Actually, it is rather unnoticeable until you are actually perspiring, which is what I think deodorant should do. Like another reviewer stated, if I want to have a stronger smell, I will use cologne or body spray.<br /><br />Since I have used it for 4 years I have not lost one shirt to this deodorant... it does not stain. I thought I should mention this since another reviewer stated it stained all his shirts. Maybe he got a bad batch or has some sort of chemical imbalance...<br /><br />In summary, if you have sensitive skin and or other deodorants have been bothering you with there wild smells, give this stuff a try.\n",

      "I love Lapsang Souchong tea, which is hard to find in retail stores. The online choices are Twinning or this Taylors of Harrogate. I won't pretend to make a \"connoisseur's\" analysis of their relative merits; to me they both taste delicious, even though I do believe this (Taylors of Harrogate) tea to have a more pronounced taste (perhaps -- see below -- because there's more tea per cup???).<br /><br />But let's look at what we're asked to pay... This one is $0.12 per bag while Twinning's is $0.16. Moreover, each Taylors of Harrogate tea bag contains 25% more tea than Twinning's (2.5gr vs 2.00gr), so that an equal-weight Twinning tea bag would have to cost $0.20, or a Twinning-size tea bag of this would only only cost $0.09. So in effect we're asked to pay over twice as much per Twinning tea bag! Now, even if there were a difference between them (and they all come from the very same Chinese makers) and the Twinning were the better-tasting tea (which I dispute), it would still not be twice as good to justify spending the extra cash.<br /><br />Yes, it's a lot of tea to buy at once; but at my rate of consumption it represents about a bit less than eight months' supply, and the shipping is free.<br /><br />Finally, regarding that misguided soul who wrote the single 1-star review complaining about the expiration date... this stuff is bone dry, packed in cellophane. It has no meaningful shelf-life limitation. If I brewed you two cups of this tea, one from a freshly-bought box and another from a box that's 1-3 years past its expiration date, I'm confident that -- in a blind test -- you would not be able to tell the old from the new.\n",

      "This wasn't as bad as expected! It smelled awful and looked like swamp sludge so I expected the worst as I took a sip. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad at all! The more I drank it, the tastier it got. It is reminiscent of Chinese herbal medicine (which is not an appealing taste to most people, but really, you learn to like it).<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I can't just say \"Oh I felt energized immediately after drinking it.\" I'm not sure if I felt anything. But this was my first cup, I'll have to edit in a few weeks or months! As for fullness, it was too thin to make me feel full. I guess if you mixed it with fruits and veggies and maybe some protein powder it would keep you full.<br /><br />All in all, I'm super pleased and will definitely buy again. Furthermore, this is an amazing price!!! It's 30% cheaper than what it would be outside of Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT: After taking this product for a couple of weeks, I can safely say that it is still amazing! It blunts my appetite tremendously, and I always feel lighter and more energized after having a cup or two of this stuff. My bowels have been awesome and my cravings for bad foods have gone away. I drink this every time I get tempted to eat something unhealthy and it works to keep me away! Heh.\n",

      "On vacation, I had breakfast at \"Two Cats\" Restaurant in Bar Harbor, ME. The breakfast was excellent, the ambience was colorful & intriguing, but it was the coffee that is my lasting memory. What a unique, delicious way to start that day. The following day I drove a considerable distance to that restaurant again just for another cup (I'd already had breakfast) AND to find out what kind of coffee they served. This product is their source. I often order coffee from Hawaii or Costa Rica and tend to buy the best brands locally, because I truly enjoy a good cup of coffee. This particular coffee has a flavor that reminds of a french or dark roast, but it lies a bit more softly and pleasingly on the palate. Like a fine wine or light dessert. There is a mellow boldness about it that satisfies with a smile and invites another sip, another savoring moment, another cup. It is one of the few super cuppa Joe's I have found that are affordable enough to be enjoyed often. The flavor/price ratio is as high as I've found.\n",

This particular tea is certainly drinkable, but it lacks any of the qualities of a good sencha. After several weeks of experimenting, I find that the best way to brew it is to use 3 times as much as I would for another sencha (I use 3 teaspoon fulls for my medium sized teapot) and then only brew it for a short time, under 3 minutes.  Also (as with all senchas), don't use boiling water, ideally no more than 190 degrees F.  And after doing all that, I get tea that I can tolerate.<br /><br />So what's my bottom line?  I won't be buying this again because the cost savings are undermined because I have to use 3 times as much to get only a reasonable tasting drink.\n",

      "My husband's deathly allergic to eggs.  After using a baking cookbook that excludes eggs, I decided I wanted to give this a try.  Overall, it is pretty good.  Basically you mix some in a separate bowl with the recommended amount of hot water.  And be sure to thoroughly mix so no lumps remain.  I left lumps once and it ended up in the muffin and the lumpy spot tasted odd.  Other than that, follow the instructions exactly and you get a powdery-smelling egg substitute.  I used it in Betty Crocker muffin mixes and it turns out just fine!  (Blueberry, choc. chip, etc)  I tried it in a Betty Crocker brownie mix and I had to throw the entire thing out, it never thickened and was a gloppy mess.  So for that recipe the eggs needed to be actual eggs!<br /><br />So if you want to do a quick boxed treat and can't use eggs for allergy/cholesterol reasons, I'd say try it.  On the back of the box there's recipes for many different foods.  I haven't tried them though.  It's not perfect but it's good in this world of egg-laden foods.\n",

      "The 60's decade box was well received and everyone enjoyed a trip down memory lane although a good portion of the products were unfamiliar not only to those raised in the 60's, but those older and younger.  Many were wondering if they were east coast products.  The price of the product for what was received was quite excessive, and the cost of the cheapest shipping was astronomical (almost as much as the product).  The box is cute, but some of the individual candy packages arrived opened with contents spilled and broken because it wasn't packaged for shipping.  Luckily I opened the box before presenting it as everything was piled together into a big heap.  I was quite surprised that there wasn't any box filler (stryofoam peanuts, bubble wrap or shredded colored paper) or that the items weren't arranged for giving.  I added my own shredded colored paper and arranged the items, but really felt for the price that it should have been professionally presented.<br /><br />Although a neat idea, I will not purchase any more of these decade boxes from this company for the reasons stated above.  I recently saw a similar item by another company that had just as many candies and was priced less than $15.\n",

      "Growing up in Southeast Asia, we had easy access to New Zealand's Anchor butter for everyday consumption. Moving to the States as an adult, I found the butters here tasteless. I thought it was just a change in my tastebuds, but when I was able to get Anchor butter again, I did a simple taste test and realized that the high quality flavour of the NZ butter was real!  I have tried all kinds of butter here - organic and not, even butters imported from France, Ireland, Germany, etc. Nothing - NOTHING - comes close to the fresh taste of New Zealand's Anchor Butter, which has hints of clover and something really special that's hard to describe!  The NZ government has very strict regulations for its cows and all, and these cows graze upon meadow grasses - you can taste it in the butter!<br /><br />So if you're reading this and getting curious - don't waste another second - order yourself some real Anchor Butter. You won't regret it, and you won't look back!\n",

The doctors had him on every antibiotic you can think of, but it never heeled. The infection was slowly moving up his leg and he couldn't stop it, and was making him sicker and sicker every day. We thought he was going to die from it. I researched a cure for \"incurable staph\" on the internet and found this honey. He coated his leg with it and his sores were all heeled within a week! The infection may still be there but the sore are all gone. All he has now is some red spots. He no longer has to take pain pills every day, and he has not been back to the stupid doctors since.

      "overall synapsis:<br /><br />The Pacific Natural Foods Organic Free Range Chix Broth is a very healthy alternative to most of the broth sold on the market(s) and it has a neutral flavor to let one either spice it up and keep it down.<br /><br />It tastes decent, not especially flavorful when compare to some other brands.<br /><br />It has lower sodium and than a lot of broths out there but the sea salt gives it a more \"salty\" taste.<br /><br />It doesn't use a lot of articificial ingredients other stock/broths put in theirs. Overall, a decent stock for general use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />(detailed review for those wanting more indepth review)<br /><br />*note* most stores sell broths (and not stock). So in my review, I often will use \"broth\" when comparing the stock to other broths(the ones in the supermarkets). Hope this helps :-)<br /><br />1) Taste:<br /><br />it is neutral, but we like to add our own ingredients to our own soups anyways. A lot of times other stock/broth have a bit too much onion, garlic, or other spices.<br /><br />This one is pretty plain in flavor thus it gives the cook/chef a lot more creativity. Because it IS organic and free range, the stock is heartier and heavier than regular watered down, steroid laden chix broths, meaning: it has a bit more \"cloudiness\" to it than the regular clear chix broth out there.<br /><br />It does leave a taste behind, not exactly an after taste but a nice finish, per se.<br /><br />We have used this stock for something as simple as homemade egg drop soup(using little bit of sliced ginger(taken out after cooking), salt to taste, and once the soup heated up, adding some dissolved corn starch, letting it boil again, turned off, then dropping a well beaten egg by drizzling it over the top of the soup to create a flowery effect, the Chinese call it \"Egg Flower Soup\" vs \"Egg Drop Soup\") to something as hearty as Minestrone.<br /><br />It's not very good all by itself as we have served this to our sick children and they can't seem to swallow it plain(myself as well when I was sick) when we just wanted some clear broth.<br /><br />Without added salt or flavoring, the broth itself is very bland.<br /><br />It doesn't have a \"canned\" taste to it and that's a nice plus<br /><br />2) Size<br /><br />it is rare to find stocks/broths in this serving size. Most broths come much larger. When I am by myself, I can just open one up without wasting the extras. And Amazon do sell the bigger sizes on the site but when you compare oz to oz, this size is actually slightly cheaper (about .007 cents) than the regular sizes making it the PERFECT serving size! (do bear in mind that prices at Amazon changes all the time.)<br /><br />3) Packaging<br /><br />we like the \"tetra-pak\" packing of this product. It doesn't have a metallic taste to it. It is nicely packed in 4 packs so it stores easily on the shelf without taking up a lot of space. Round cans really waste spaces while these tetra/square packes utilize every inch of the cabinet space.<br /><br />the only downside to the packaging is that it is NOT recyclable(for us, in our area).<br /><br />4) Does it \"groove?\" (make gravy)<br /><br />Why this matters...<br /><br />a lot of folks like to make gravies with their broth. And we have been asked by our friends quite a bit why we prefer to use stocks vs. broths when it comes to making gravy.<br /><br />For those that are interested:<br /><br />there is a bit of difference between stock and broth. Stock are bones/marrow cooked thus more gelatinous, broth are meat prepped so it doesn't have gelatin to it. This makes a difference when one wants to make something thick like gravy.<br /><br />a good gravy requires a bit of help from the stock itself, to gelatinize, and while one can make gravy with broth, stocks are superior when it comes to making things such as gravies.<br /><br />This stock, however, doesn't make gravy well for some reason. Not sure why. We've tested it a few times, it requires much more flour than the conventional recipes. So bare that in mind if you want to make gravy with the this stock. On the other hand, I'd highly recommend the stock made by \"wolfgang Puck\" it is a better stock both in flavor and \"grooving\" ability. LOL<br /><br />5) Odds and Ends<br /><br />this broth is a good and healthy alternative to those that like lower sodium options and do not like a lot of flavoring to their soup. What makes it even better is not just that it is organic, but free range.<br /><br />By definition, organic means that the chickens are not fed hormones and are fed natural grains, but that doesn't mean that they can roam free, they might still be caged up in a limited space. Free range means the chicken can roam more freely(although some farmers have argued that chicken that can have 10 feet of range is consider free range, it is still better than being couped up in a 3\" X 3\" square with their beaks cut off and being injected by nothing but steroids). A chicken that can roam is definitely a healthier chicken. They produce more muscular meat and healthier bones and we get to benefit from that.<br /><br />We have switched to as much free range chicken as we could afford while at least all organic and have seen a good healthy change in our bodies along with other diets and exercises.<br /><br />I would also recommend having Wolfgang Pucks Organic Chicken Broth and chicken stock on hand (they sell it here on Amazon). The Wolfgang Puck brand stock is more flavorful and stands more on its own and creates recipes that are more flavorful.<br /><br />We use this product whenever we want to serve something more neutral when pairing with other more flavorful foods.<br /><br />On a sick day, the Wolfgang Puck BROTH is superior by itself. (in plain taste, we prefer broths over stocks, the Wolfgang Puck's broth is excellent by itself!)<br /><br />But we still like this product a lot, for its healthy and neutral taste thus giving us a lot of room for creativity<br /><br />*note* some of the folks have complained that it is too salty while others stated that it is low sodium. I personally think everyone's taste buds are different and I have cooked for folks for dinner at the same time that would say my dishes are too salty to not salty at all. I think some of that has to do with the way we grow up, the way our genetics are, and our age and habits.<br /><br />If a person has cut down on their salt intake for a period of time, their taste buds will be more sensitive to salt.<br /><br />In this case, sea salt is a very strong salt. Using just a pinch of it can equal to the 30 times the taste of the table spoon salt. But the sodium level is still lower because less salt is used.<br /><br />I can see why some folks would say it tastes too salty while others say it is not that salty.<br /><br />To me and my wife, our salt intake tend to be on the higher end so this broth doesn't taste \"salty\" to us. Hope this helps.<br /><br />****totally unimportant view****<br /><br />btw, no matter how healthy or good the broth is for humans, it is always bad for the chicken(s)themselves: organic, free range, or caged...makes one wonder if they'd ever think: \"maybe we shouldn't cross the road...because the butcher is on the other side...\"\n",

      "The best, most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9\" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9\" pies (2 cup volume). If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives.  The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't overbake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />On average, this 15 oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!\n",

      "Our puppy, Rocky, has recently outgrown puppy food (maybe because he's now fifty pounds), but for his first six months we fed him Pedigree Little Champions Morsels in Sauce with Chicken over a scoop of dry food. He was much more enthusiastic about eating dry food when it came with this \"delicious\" topping.<br /><br />We have been getting our pet food from Amazon for several months, and it is working out well for us. The price is competitive, we don't have to lug home cases of food, and--most importantly--we don't have to deal with the local Big Box, where sometimes they have food that our pets will eat, but more often they are out of stock.\n",

      "This soup is not only high in Vitamin A and C but is great to have on hand for a quick lunch or dinner, either alone with supplemented with bread or crackers and a salad. It is also completely gluten-free.<br /><br />Imagine this: you're hungry, don't have anything on hand, don't want to out and buy groceries. With a 12 pack of this on hand (currently averaging $2.50 a can but a deal because it is so filling), you simply need to open the can, heat it and add whatever you want to offset the low sodium - unless you are on a low-sodium diet. I'm NOT on a low-sodium diet and don't mind the lack of salt. However, if you want a stronger or saltier taste, you can add a bit of regular or garlic salt or salt substitute. I also prefer to add a dollop of sour cream or low-fat yogurt and that makes a HUGE difference. With some crackers, I'm set for lunch or even dinner.<br /><br />Look below for the nutritional content and other benefits but don't overlook those impressive amounts of Vitamin A and C. Sure, you'll need more for your daily requirements but this doesn't have that horrible preservative taste of other canned soups and my whole family loves it. I sometimes add a bit of chicken or vegetable broth and add some lightly sauteed onions or celery. But none of that is necessary. Good to have on hand for power outages, blizzards or times when you need food and the stove won't work. It can be eaten cold in a pinch.<br /><br />Other pros:<br /><br />1. No trans fats, MSG or preservatives. NO GMOS, no bio-engineered ingredients.<br /><br />2. Tastes a bit bland by itself (low sodium) but add some pepper, a bit of salt and a dollop of sour cream and yogurt and it is elevated to a far tastier soup.<br /><br />3. Great to have on hand for emergencies or when you're rushed for time and need a quick meal. Perhaps hearty eaters would want more but I find a can to be totally satisfying and hearty enough to keep me full till dinner or eve as a dinner entree.<br /><br />4. My whole family likes it but they do prefer salt. So take a chance on this and see if your family likes it. If they do, having this on hand could be a major time saver and you'll know they aren't getting trans fats.<br /><br />5. Relatively high vitamin content compared to other commercial soups.<br /><br />Nutritional content (daily values): Vitamin A- 45 percent, Vitamin C - 20 percent, Calcium - 6%, Iron - 15%, Fat - only 4 grams (no trans fat and only .5% of saturated fat), no cholesterol, 340 mg sodium, 24 grams of carbs, dietary fiber 32%, protein - 7 grams, sugars - 5 grams.<br /><br />We find that if we have this soup before a larger meal we don't feel inclined to eat as much. If you are trying to lose weight, this is a plus. Each can is around 360 calories unless you want to stretch this to 2 servings. I don't prefer to do that but if you have toddlers or very young children, half a can should be plenty. I'm sold on this wonderful soup!\n",

      "Update #1, I've owned it for over 1 year and make 6 shots per day. It makes excellent espresso and has worked perfectly. I have upgraded it from 4 to 5 stars. It's still a bit noisy and inexpensive looking, but it works great.<br /><br />Original review... My impression upon unpacking is that there's a lot of plastic used everywhere visible. In fact the only metal visible is on the frothing wand.  At the price point I don't object, but be ready for it. The plastic used is similar to that used in model cars and planes, rigid, but possible breakable.  It is, however, reassuringly thick and I expect it to be durable.<br /><br />The Vienna Plus has a \"form follows function\" look as opposed to \"styled\".  To my eye it's sort of an R2D2 look.  Another reviewer said VW Beetle looking...I can see that too.<br /><br />My hand fits into a recess in the back of the water tank perfectly making it a cinch to remove and carry.  Frothing the milk is very easy.  Depress the steam button, wait for the green light and twist the steam valve knob on the right hand side until the water spurts stop and only steam comes out.  Twist the knob the other way to stop the steam, submerge the tip of the wand in your cold milk and reopen the steam valve. That's it.  You don't have to do anything else because the \"Panarello\" wand draws air in from the top.  That means you don't have to keep the tip just at the milk's surface, submerged works just fine.<br /><br />After you froth the milk it takes quite a while to cool the boiler enough to make espresso.  If you \"un-depress\" the steam button, open the steam valve and run some water through the wand it will cool the boiler enough to stop the blinking \"too hot\" lights in a few seconds.<br /><br />Both the grind and quantity of ground coffee can be adjusted whilst it's grinding.  Mine remains at the mid range factory settings.  The espresso comes out hot and rich with lots of crema.  It does make noise during the pre-brew, brew and grounds expelling process.  For maintenance, removing the brew unit to rinse under hot water is very easy.  I'm impressed with the ease of use, maintenance and the flavor of the espresso.\n",

      "Light Muscovado is a caramel light brown sugar with the flavors of earth and sky somehow infused into dreamy sweet perfection. All other light brown sugars can't compare to this quality and if you want the best light brown sugar for baking, I can't imagine anything could be more delicious.<br /><br />Light Muscovado is slightly moist, has a medium molasses content and is delicious in gingerbread, coffee cake, cookies and chocolate cake. It is delicious with a Farina porridge in the morning or can be stirred into tea.<br /><br />I first found this sugar while working at Larry's Market in Seattle. The India Tree company is also located in Seattle and has some amazing sugar products for baking and decorating.<br /><br />Also recommended: Dark Muscovado is also deeply delicious and once you use the Muscovado sugars, there is no escape. You will crave the rich flavors and high molasses content of this delicious sugar from Mauritius.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "The ingredients list on Amazon is incorrect according to the label on the food. I purchased this food through PetFoodDirect, and their website has the same incorrect list, as does the By Nature website itself as of this date (July 17, 2011). The label on the food I bought says that the food also contains pea flour and menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite (a toxic synthetic vitamin K). I emailed By Nature about this, and received this reply on June 29, 2011 from Ray Devone, Customer Service Coordinator, Kent Nutrition Group:<br /><br />\"Thank you for calling these apparent discrepancies to our attention! There has never been Menadione in any of our foods. In fact, we printed labels listing this ingredient and decided to forgo adding this controversial supplement to our foods - after the labels went to print. Obviously, we have not run out of this first printing of labels yet - and I have asked that we put a 'blip' somewhere with words to  that effect.  We did indeed switch from the controversial gums and carrageenan to pea flour and I have further asked that we update websites, as well as labels for accuracy sake.  To answer your question:  The pea flour is new; the Menadione never was.\"<br /><br />The label on the food also lists guar gum and locust bean gum, so I'm not sure what controversial gums the pea flour replaced.<br /><br />Anyway, if your cats don't like pea flour (mine don't) or you're looking for a low-carbohydrate food, avoid By Nature Organics Chicken & Chicken Liver canned cat food.<br /><br />Truth in labeling matters.\n",

In Sweden, lingon are the natural accompaniment for mashed potatoes; you can buy a cone of mashed potatoes with lingon at the late night fast food stands. The Swedes who colonized Delaware and New Jersey were so eager to replace the lingon in their diet that they picked the nasty, bitter wild cranberries, mixed them with sugar, and invented an American tradition. But \"believe you me\" cranberry sauce is no match for real lingon as a relish for roast meats.\n",

      "Please read my update at the end of this original review:<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut wataers since my previous beloved Zico went nasty (from concentrate, sour, sodium enhanced, yuck). I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco. Previously, I had tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling \"coconut water taste tests\" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. Second fave is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E.<br /><br />I can say this to coconu water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. I'm gonna order some more A&B CW very soon (I have 2.5 cases of Nature Factor's, and about 4 tetras left of the O.N.E., and I will drink those. I have 35 bottles left of the Zico (new formula) and I may just water my gardenia and hibiscus bushes with those.)<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can: 17.5 ounces. If you're really thirsty, this one is welcome. (I often drink two 10 ounce cans of Nature Factor's brand during supper, so having one can do the trick is handy).<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D  Because another reviewer called it \"unnaturally sweet\", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can:  31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />A&B is \"flash pasteurized\", which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google \"Crossfit Adventure\" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B.<br /><br />They use Thai coconuts. :)<br /><br />Addendum: For carb watchers-- The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce:<br /><br />Amy & Brian: 2.375<br />Nature Factor Organic: 1.6<br />O.N.E.: 1.33<br />New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07<br /><br />I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce.<br /><br />I wonder if, since the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be targeted to have higher carbs/more sweetness?<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order in the 10 oz cans tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's \"jiggered\" for consistency.) I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. Hope the update helps you in making a decision.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Yes, I ordered two more cases of large cans of this brand in the pulp version, and it's fantastic. So, it seems the \"badness\" is limited (so far as I can tell) to the smaller cans. I'm editing the header of this review accordingly. Every single large can/case I've ordered has been delicious and refreshing and coconutty. The small cans are candy water and suck.So, AVOID THE SMALL cans until that problem is resolved. But I trust the taste of the large cans to have placed an order for 7 cases during this month's super sale of A&B. HTH.\n",

      "I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info.  I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella).  If you make the kit by following the instructions, it will turn out dry.  I drink dry, but my preference is for a wine to be slightly dry, so I make modifications to the program.<br /><br />I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there. I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida. I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon. I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits. They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine. Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else. We each have our own preferences. I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of [...] to [...] a bottle. And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano. I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies. I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly. If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084. By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better. That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%. Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store). Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling. Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons. To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff. Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption. Cheers.<br /><br />Dec 31, 2010 Update!!!<br /><br />We opened several bottles of the Valpolicella over the holidays.  This is from wine that I made in March 2010.  With every batch, I retain 2 - 5 bottles and let age somewhat.  Usually I drink the rest, beginning immediately after bottling.  The wine is pretty good, even though it is pretty young.  Let me state for the record, this is my preference and everyone's taste is different.  Make/drink what you like, and don't let anyone tell you its wrong...  The Valpolicella that we drank over the holidays had aged about 9 months, and I must say, it was very good. The aging had made a good wine even better.  For the most part, I followed the instructions included in the kit with some additions.  In this batch, I had added 2 lbs of corn syrup and about 1 1/2 cups of black oak chips to the kit at the start of the fermentation process.  The alcohol content, after 2 weeks of fermentation, calculated to be around 14.7%.  A little high, and no doubt due to the added corn syrup.  I racked the wine, clarified and aged it another 4 weeks before bottling.  And when I bottled the wine, I back-sweetened with another 1 lb of corn syrup and added some potassium metabisulfite (1/4 tsp dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to preserve and prevent after-fermentation).  This wine has received the most compliments from family and friends.  I just ordered 2 more kits and will try to replicate the recipe (I keep a wine log of every batch so as to capture the important points of the good, and the bad!).  I hope this helps with your wine making and you enjoy the fruits of the vine as much as I do...  Cheers.  Sam<br /><br />May 2012 Update!!!<br /><br />I have made a couple of changes to the recipe that have been an improvement.  First, I included the recommendation from another review that said to make the kit to only 5 gallons instead of the 6 gallons that the recipe calls for.  Sure, you get 4 less bottles of wine.  But, this improves the fullness of the wine and its finish.  Secondly, I boil 2 - 4 ounces of dark oak chips in a quart of water for 5 minutes. This is then added to the juice and then diluted to the 5 gallon level.  Be sure to let the whole solution cool to 70 - 75 deg F before the yeast is added.  Add the oak chips and all the liquid!  This really improves the flavor, adding a powerful oak flavor that smooths the final wine and improves its overall taste.  I have incorporated both these steps into all the Vino Italiano wine kits.\n",

For example, it could make a great, spicy sauce for baked chicken.  I've used it in soups and also mixed it with sour cream and served it with tortilla chips.\n",

      "i've often used instant coffee in a jar since no one else in the house drinks it and making a pot regardless of the size is a bit of a hassle. jar coffee loses its robust-ness after a while, it sort of 'stales'. being this coffee comes in little single serve sleeves it is always fresh. and the flavor was surprising and when it hits the hot water it smells brewed, mmm good. i first tried it when i picked up a pack of 6 at my local target for only $1 (appx .17 per cup!). so then i thought i'd see if i can get a better deal on amazon for larger quantity. i don't care for super strong starbuck kind of coffee so i make mine using about 10-12oz of water verses the recommended 8oz. but if you like yours more full bodied i don't think this coffee will disappoint. ps. DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'... so now i'm back ordering the good stuff.\n",

      "I've used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly. It is delicious and easy. Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid: just add it to a cup of water to make the broth. This is not like the low-salt, low-fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you've cooked from scratch. Comes in beef, chicken, and turkey flavors. I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen.<br />Update 2010: I'm still ordering and using the chicken broth and the beef broth as staples in my pantry and on the RV. I've given packets away to friends so they can enjoy these excellent products. While cooking, you can squeeze the packet into your food and add the cup of water, then stir. Easy and a big saving in shelf space over cans.\n"

      "I have been making bread machine bread for about four years now.  Until recently I'd been using the little brown jars of Fleischmann's or Red Star bread machine yeast because I thought that was all there was.  Then my local markets stopped carrying that variety.  The little packets are way too expensive and I had a sad experience with cratered loaves and uneven texture when one cookbook assured me that active dry yeast would work fine with bread machines.<br /><br />This yeast is amazing.  Once I figured out the exact amount to use with my machine I've been getting beautifully rounded, fine textured whole wheat loaves every single time. It's stunningly better than the stuff you buy in the grocery store.  I've been following the other reviewers' advice on how to store and keep the yeast, since I think I've got enough for several years.  I wasn't quite clear on how much yeast I was buying here.  One pound seemed a better deal than the grocery stores offer.  But four pounds . . . it's practically free.\n",

It's officially become a cupboard resident right up there next to the olive oil, flour and salt.  I don't know how I managed to cook BEFORE I began using this product, but I know it's now permanently on my shopping list and I don't plan to run out of it.<br /><br />A little goes a long way...<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this to do a quick egg scramble.  I've used it for pancakes, sauteed veggies, even folded it into the mashed potatoes!  It's a miracle ingredient.  My family was going to throw out some cold french fries from the night before and I said, \"No way!\" In this economy, I'm watching every dime.  So, with just two teaspoons of ghee, I was able to crisp up the fries in the skillet. They were absolutely delicious, and because this ghee is unsalted, I can control the fat AND the salt in my dishes.  What a godsend.<br /><br />Best of all, it doesn't need refrigeration.  I keep it in the cupboard and at room temp, it's done just fine.  Then again, the longest a 28oz jar has lasted in this house has been one month.  I'm now upgrading to the 56oz jar as it's cheaper by the ounce.\n",

However, the dish was not secured to the box and neither was the tree!  Knowing how the mail deliverers handle packages, I'm not surprised that five WHOLE branches had been broken off because the tree bounced against the sides and most likely the top of the box!!

      "I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven't experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup. I fill used K-Cups and Kap them days before I plan to use them and seal the hole in the top of the Kap and the hole in the bottom of the K-Cup with those \"dot-type\" stickers one can get in office supply stores and discount stores. This keeps the coffee/tea/hot chocolate, etc. from getting stale before brewing. To clean used K-Cups, I bought a cheap eyebrow brush to \"sweep\" the wet grounds out of the Cup and filter after use. I do keep numerous used, clean and dry K-Cups to fill and cap while recently used K-Cups are drying. I've found that the regular grind coffee that I buy in the grocery store works well for brewing as fine grind coffee tends to clog the needle in the brewer. To get the correct strength in tea, I fill the K-Cup with the equivalent of 2 teabags, then cap. For coffee, I fill the K-Cup to nearly the bottom edge of the K-Kap. So far my Kaps are working well and saving me money. Before discovering these, I was somewhat regretting having bought my Keurig brewer because of the high cost of the K-Cups and the number of people living in my house who drink multiple cups of coffee daily. The bill for buying K-Cups was starting to look like my mortgage payment! These saved my bank account.\n",

The monopoly of coffee from Green Mountain largely can't deliver that bold taste. But I just brewed my first Starbucks French Roast K-cups. First, the aroma from the brew instantly reminded of Starbucks. Then the first sip. WOW!!! I couldn't believe how good this coffee is. I couldn't believe that my machine just made it. I can honestly say this was the BEST cup of coffee from my machine over the past 5 years. It is as good, if not better, than what you get when you visit Starbucks.

I fell in love with this stuff in the Caymen Islands and finally found it through Amazon.  It's a fabulous flavor-- mixing the 'zing' with a bit of unique sweetness.  Unbelievable on most everything...meat (pulled pork, hamburgers etc.),pizza, soups (especially chili), with snacks and appetizers (like hummas), and in pasta (my favorite....mac n cheese for a nice variation).  I bought three bottles this time, to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  One thing to be aware of is the thick texture.  I added about an once of filtered water to bring it to a more desirable consistency for myself, after having used a small portion...I just added the water and shook it up.  To me, this sauce is not just HOT like some of the others out there that have no flavor attached to the heat, instead, it just has a fabulous, dynamic flavor that I simply can't get enough of.  At less than four dollars a bottle...you CANNOT pass this JCS scotch bonnet sauce up!\n",

      "I regularly get the Starbucks coffee syrups for my lattes because they are easy to get and have great flavor. I hoped to buy the pumpkin spice syrup from Starbucks however they are not sold at any store.  So I found this after reading the reviews i was hopeful as one person tried the pumpkin spice and said it was horrible then they tried this one and enjoyed it.  I was excited to bring in the fall with a pumpkin latte this morning.  However i was surprised. my wife warned me that it was bitter and did not taste good.  I didn't believe her and made a latte following the instructions on the bottle which is nice. 2 pumps (it suggested 1.5) and I didn't taste much just some bitterness. so i doubled it and put in 4 pumps. it tasted nothing like pumpkin pie that i have made or bought in a store it was bitter and had a spice flavor to it.  it also tasted nothing like the Starbucks pumpkin latte i have had in the past, i tried drinking it to see if it got better but i could not do it. so i tried the syrup by itself and it was gross! bitter and nothing like pumpkin pie.  not sure if i got a bad batch or if this product just is horrible.<br /><br />Edited update.<br /><br />I just got off the phone with Amoretti and remade myself a latte with some new information.... First the Starbucks syrup that i use has 19 grams of sugar in every pump Amoretti has 4 grams.  This is significant if you have a sweet tooth and if you try to watch the calories.  In the 4 pumps of Starbucks syrup for my latte I am getting 76 grams of sugar with Amoretti i got 16 grams of sugar.  If you have a sweet tooth like me that makes a huge difference. Second the syrup is more of a syrup than sugar water like Starbucks so it is full of flavors.  When I put 4 pumps because it wasn't sweet it did make it bitter because i put in way to many spices.  so when i remade my latte (total 16 ounces) I put in 2 pumps, 1 at first and didn't taste anything so i added another one, with some agave nectar for my sweet tooth.  When i tried it there is no bitterness just pumpkin pie flavor that i can taste :)  So lesson learned read the directions and don't think every syrup is made the same.  The Amoretti is healthier and full of flavors, to much and it will be bitter, follow the directions around 1 pump for every 8 ounces.  Amoretti had great customer service when they called and explained the difference in the syrup. I assumed it would be like Starbucks and was wrong. Right now i am enjoying a pumpkin latte with the Amoretti pumpkin syrup.  They have a full line of syrups and i look forward to trying the CREMA DI syrups which have a creamer flavor which i like, can't wait for them to arrive.\n",

This is the same chemical that is present in acid rain, which can eat the paint off your car, deteriorate buildings, etc.  This product is the only one I've ever seen that doesn't contain this chemical.  This product tastes better and fresher than any store-bought dried pineapple and the fact that it contains only natural ingredients is a big plus.\n",

And yes it is a wine specific to Olive Garden but you can find it at local suppliers or online.\n",

      "Our first taste of Super Veggie made my wife and I reminiscent of a Bloody Mary. So much so, that we squeezed some lime in along with black pepper, a dash of celery seed and tabasco. No alcohol though, so I guess it would be considered a Virgin Mary! It was delicious and now we have one each evening.<br /><br />I have been drinking V8 Lower Sodium for quite a few years and have recently switched to Super Veggie for the additional health qualities. When compared to V8, it seems to be superior in every aspect. Super Veggie has a lot less sodium, higher fiber, less tomato and more of the other juices. I feel that it is more comparable to an actual serving of vegetables than V8. I'm very happy with this product.<br /><br />I gave Super Veggie 4 stars because it is 3 times as expensive as V8. I have calculated that I pay about 15 cents an ounce for Super Veggie, and a little less than 5 cents an ounce for V8. Don't get me wrong, Super Veggie is worth it. I think the health benefits make this product a dietary necessity. I just wish it was a little more affordable.\n",

      "This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well. It's got a great cherry apple taste to it that is not overpowering and if you let it steep about three minutes you're bound to enjoy it as much as I do!<br /><br />Each bag contains all-natural ingredients including hibiscus, cinnamon, chamomile, cranberries and apples. There's some vitamin C in it, too. There are no artificial ingredients! The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it. It's also kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry apple, very slightly tart flavor to your tea, this is highly recommended! Enjoy!\n",

      "Ro-Tel has a variety of diced tomatoes flavored for every taste.  For fresh, home style salsa, you can't beat their Lime and Cilantro version.  For tacos, use the Medium Hot version.  But the hands down, all around best is their Hot Diced Tomatoes with Habanero.<br /><br />If you love hot Mexican cooking like I do, you'll think you died and went to Heaven with this!  It is definitely NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!  Habanero is the hottest of all the peppers you can eat.  It is off the Scovill Scale of hotness like Einstein is off the IQ scale.  But, at the same time, it is versatile and its uses are only limited by your imagination.  Need to tone it down, add some sour cream or Philly cream cheese, or drain off the water in the can and mix into your recipe that way.  Mix it into chili and simmer it down with lots of water for superb flavor and eye-watering heat.  For parties, stir into a pot of nacho cheese for a zip that everybody will remember.<br /><br />Can you tell I love this stuff? But don't take my word for it, try it yourself -- you'll love it!\n",

The coffee tastes great and is so smooth that I can totally skip the creamer and just add a pack of organic sugar and I am in happy coffee wake-up land.  Look, it is definately not the whole bean, grind it just before brewing, french press, orgnic, single origin, Ethiopian coffee we brew at home; but is sure is a great fix for work and they store great in my cubicle with no mess.

      "This box comes with a copious amount of candy with an abundance of flavors.  I personally don't like sour drops/lollipops so I didn't particularly like this set.  Most (maybe 9/12 pouches) have citrus or sour flavored candy that comes in assortments like Mango Tango, Watermelon, and Pomegranate Pucker.  So as such, I brought in the candies in a basket to the corner of my office desk and everyone drops on by to tell me how delicious they are.  It's relatively cheap so if you're working in an administrative position, this purchase might be an easy way to spark up conversations or get noticed around the office.  My personal favorites were Pomegranate and Root Beer.  If you're thinking of getting this candy for yourself, it is WAY too much for any ordinary sweet-toothed person to eat.  You WILL have to share or give them to family or friends.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great drop/lollipop pack for the price with very interesting (and unforgettable) flavors.  If you buy this particular box, you will have to share or give away various pouches unless you want to develop cavities.<br /><br />NOTE THAT THESE CANDIES ARE NOT SUGAR FREE, they are ONLY GLUTEN FREE for people with various disorders.  They are still very sweet (and sour).\n",

This relish nicely balances salty, sour, bitter, and chile flavors with a good blend of accompanying spices. If you like Indian pickles, try this. I put it on eggs, quesadillas, rice, Indian style flatbreads, vegetables, fish, etc. Basically, everything but dessert. I will warn that it is addictive!\n",
