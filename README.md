### This Contains Three Projects that I've worked on during and after my Machine Learning course. 

#### - Project One : Amazon Review
 
 This project focuses on linear classfication and analyzing words. Based on the Amazon reviews we are given, The goal is to train the machine from what's been marked as helpful reviews to later then successfully predict what kind of review would be helpful for shoppers. I focused on process the data and find what do the helpful comments have in common. However, the data itself wasn't super accurate. From just reading the texts, some of the comments are marked helpful but wasn't really helpful in my opinion as a shopper, and vice vesa. It was interesting to then see how my prediction was effected by the classifications. Regardless to the algorithm, because the classfication is somewhat biased. It has affected the usefulness of this tool.
 
 
 
 #### - Project Two : Image Recognition - Air Planes
 
  This project, we tapped into Deep Learning and Nerual Networks. We were given the tasks to train an AI to be able to successfully identify whether a plane exits in an image or not. For this project I focused more on the algorithms and models. I tried to tweak more with the algrothms and features this time and see how they would affect the perfomances. Changing each valuable and test out different tolerance to get a better understanding on how the algorithms work. I was able to achive a high level of accuracy.
  
  
  
 #### - Project Three : Food Contamination
  For this project, we started to dive into unsupervised learning. We have the choice to work with data on food contamination to cluster incident descriptions into broader categories. I decided to categorize the contamination by food items. This is also related to natural language. I decide to focus more on how to process and treat raw texts accurately and objectively. I worked with the nltk library and tried to clean up the raw texts as much as I can. The results varies depends on the clusters. Some of them are very accurate and some are very hard to see connections.
